Passage:By the early 1890s he had moved away from Bavaria and, with his brother, was working in Duisburg. Together the brothers smuggled subversive anarchist literature into Germany from the Netherlands. Coming under increasing police pressure, and taking his queue from a number of other anarchist comrades in a similar predicament, early in 1892 he fled to the United States of America. On his arrival at New York he met up with the circle around Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and politically like-minded comrades from Germany. Sepp Orter discovered in himself a talent for activism, turning out to have a flair for public speaking. During 1892 he was also the editor of the New York version of , published by the \\"Radical Workers' Association\\" (\\"Radikaler Arbeiter Bund\\") and the \\"Autonomy\\" group which also numbered among its members Josef Peukert. The stay in America was cut short, however. The authorities suspected that Oerter had somehow been involved in Alexander Berkman's attempt to assassinate a wealthy businessman called Henry Clay Frick. Those suspicions appear not to have been entirely unfounded. With financial assistance from Emma Goldman, Sepp Oerter returned to Germany. He travelled via London where he arrived in October, and where the editorial group publishing \\"Autonomy\\" gave him a mission to take printed material across Belgium to the German frontier in order to effect a clandestine introduction of the anarchist propaganda to Germany. Sepp Oerter was able to complete his mission with the help of his brother Fritz who had stayed behind when Sepp had escaped to America.","target":"b","rationale":"The information about the country through which Oerter had passed on his return trip to Germany is available from the proper nouns \\"Germany\\", \\"USA\\", \\"London\\" and \\"Belgium\\".

It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia. Unveiled in 1935, the 42-metre (138 ft) high monument of granite, travertine, and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.\\nThe sculptures and bas-reliefs of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a 19-metre (62 ft) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \\"memorial column\\". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme \\"Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!\\" (\\"Shine like a star!\\") submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle. Construction works were financed by private donations.\\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered it to be of high artistic value. In 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was dismissed by Soviet authorities as the destruction of the building would have caused deep indignation and tension in society.

However, at the same time, CNNs are capable of memorizing all labels even if they are random, which means they can memorize corrupted labels. Are CNNs robust or fragile to label noise? Much of researches focusing on such memorization uses class-independent label noise to simulate label corruption, but this setting is simple and unrealistic. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of CNNs under class-dependently simulated label noise, which is generated based on the conceptual distance between classes of a large dataset (i.e., ImageNet-1k). Contrary to previous knowledge, we reveal CNNs are more robust to such class-dependent label noise than class-independent label noise.

Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR−/−) mice after vaccination with the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides. the first time NiV emerged in southern India [2] . Two strains of NiV have been identified, Malaysia and Bangladesh strains, which share 91.8% sequence homology [3] . NiV causes severe respiratory disease and encephalitis [4] [5] [6] , with average case fatality rates (CFR) of 40-75% [7] . Moreover, long-term neurological sequelae and even relapse of encephalitis are observed in many survivors of infections with both strains of NiV [8] [9] [10] . The natural reservoir of NiV and Hendra virus (HeV) are the fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, which are widely distributed in Asia, Australasia, and parts of Africa [11, 12] . Moreover, NiV has a broad species tropism and can cause disease in a many animal species [13] [14] [15] . NiV can infect humans via several routes, which include the consumption of food contaminated with bat secretions [16], transmission from amplification hosts such as pigs [4] , and direct human-to-human transmission between very close contacts [17] . Currently there are no licensed treatments or preventative vaccines available for use in humans, which make the development of effective prophylactic measures imperative. Evidence to date indicates that the Henipavirus glycoprotein G is a highly promising target of virus-neutralizing antibodies to counteract infections with highly pathogenic henipaviruses. The G glycoproteins of NiV and HeV share 83% amino acid sequence homology and are type II transmembrane proteins [18] . The glycoproteins of both viruses bind to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 [19] [20] [21] [22] , which are highly conserved across many species [23] . To date, the most promising therapeutic approach against Henipavirus infection is the one based on the application of the experimental human monoclonal antibody m102.4, which binds the ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 receptor-binding site on the glycoproteins of HeV (HeV-G) and NiV (NiV-G) [24] . The protective efficacy of m102.4 has been successfully evaluated in different preclinical models including ferrets and African green monkeys (AGM) [25] [26] [27] . Currently, several vaccines delivering NiV-G have been shown to protect against lethal challenge infections in preclinical testing. These candidate vaccines include recombinant viruses developed using vaccinia virus [28], canarypox [29], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [30-34], rabies virus [35], measles virus [36], and adenovirus platforms [37, 38] . To date, the only licensed Henipavirus vaccine is the equine vaccine against HeV, Equivac ® HeV, which was approved for use in horses in Australia in 2012 [39]. This vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which comprises the soluble form of HeV-G (HeVsG) [19, [39] [40] [41] . The subunit HeVsG vaccine has been shown to protect against NiV in cats [42], ferrets [43] , and non-human primates [44], but not in pigs [45] . The ability of HeVsG to protect against NiV infection in some animal models warrants the evaluation of a vaccine that contains a soluble form of NiV glycoprotein G. The role of antibodies in protective immunization against NiV infection has been widely reported, however there is limited information on NiV-specific T-cell-mediated immunity. Consequently, it is of interest to better understand the role of T cells in vaccine-induced protection against NiV. This, in turn, will aide in the development of new and improved vaccine candidates. In this study, we investigated recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) for delivery of NiV-G antigens [46] . We constructed two MVA-NiV-G vaccine candidates to express full-length NiV-G or the soluble form NiVsG. The candidate vaccines were genetically stable and efficiently replicated in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts, a cell culture system used for manufacturing of MVA vaccines. Importantly, vaccination of mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR−/−) elicited readily detectable NiV-G-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. We identified a potential H2-b-restricted epitope in the NiV-G that stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T cells and a potential H2-IAb-restricted epitope that stimulated antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Interestingly, in comparison with full-length NiV-G, the soluble antigen NiVsG induced significantly stronger epitope-specific T cell responses. Our work will be relevant for future studies characterizing NiV-G-specific T cell responses in NiV preclinical models. Materials and Methods IFNAR−/− mice [47] backcrossed more than 20-fold on the C57BL/6 background (were bred under specified-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, housed in isolated cage units (IsoCage, Tecniplast, \\n Title: A Soluble Version of Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G Delivered by Vaccinia Virus MVA Activates Specific CD8 and CD4 T Cells in Mice","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides a brief summary of the main findings and methods of the study.

Harpo kindly helps ladies with their shopping bags, all the while pilfering their groceries and stuffing them in the pockets of his long trench coat. When the elegant Madame Egelichi (Ilona Massey) arrives, store manager Lefty Throckmorton (Melville Cooper) tells her that \\"the sardines\\" have come in. Harpo sneaks into the basement and watches as Lefty lovingly unpacks a sardine can marked with a Maltese cross, and swipes the can from Lefty's pocket, replacing it with an unmarked one. Madame Egelichi, who has gone through eight husbands in three months in her quest for the Romanoff diamonds, is furious when Lefty produces the wrong can. When Lefty remembers seeing Harpo in the basement, she orders him to call the police and offer a $1,000 reward for his capture.At the theater, meanwhile, unemployed entertainer Faustino the Great (Chico Marx) asks Mike for a job as a mind-reader, and when Faustino's clever improvisation stops the show's backer, Mr. Lyons (Leon Belasco), from repossessing the scenery, Mike gratefully hires him. Harpo, who is secretly in love with dancer Maggie Phillips (Vera-Ellen), Mike's girl friend, gives her the sardine can, and she says she will eat them tomorrow. A policeman sees Harpo inside the theater and brings him to Madame Egelichi, who turns Harpo over to her henchmen, Alphonse (Raymond Burr) and Hannibal (Bruce Gordon) Zoto. After three days of interrogation, Harpo still refuses to talk, and when he is left alone, he calls Faustino at the theater, using the bike horn he carries in his pocket to communicate. Madame Egelichi listens on the extension as Faustino declares that there are plenty of sardines at the theater, and she goes there at once.Meanwhile, Mike has just finished telling the troupe that they do not have enough money to open when Madame Egelichi arrives and offers to finance the show. Mike cancels his plans to take Maggie out for her birthday so that he and his new backer can discuss the arrangements. In the alley outside the theater, Harpo, having escaped from Madame Egelichi's suite, finds the diamonds in the sardine can which had been set out for a cat, and puts them in his pocket. When he finds Maggie crying in her dressing room, Harpo takes her to Central Park, where he plays the harp for her and gives her the diamonds as a birthday gift.On the opening night of the show, Grunion is visited by an agent of the Romanoff family, who threatens to kill him if he does not produce the diamonds in an hour. At the theater, Lefty and the Zoto brothers spy through a window as Maggie puts on the diamond necklace, but Mike asks her not to wear it, promising to buy her an engagement ring instead. As they kiss, Maggie removes the necklace and drops it on the piano strings. The curtain goes up, and when Harpo sees Lefty and the Zoto brothers menacing Maggie, he distracts them with a piece of costume jewelry and leads them up to the roof.Meanwhile, on stage, Faustino plays the piano, and when he strikes the keys forcefully, the diamond necklace flies into the air, drawing the attention of Madame Egelichi, who is watching from the audience. Faustino pockets the diamonds, then rushes to the roof to help Harpo. Madame Egelichi shows up with a gun and demands the necklace, but Faustino gives her the fake diamonds. After tying up Lefty and the Zotos and recovering the real diamonds, Harpo encounters Grunion, who has been hiding on the roof.

Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches Antarctic waters. An albatross appears and leads them out of the ice jam where they are stuck, but even as the albatross is praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:\\nWith my cross-bow,\\n\\nI shot the albatross.\\nThe crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist appears:\\n'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\\n\\nThat bring the fog and mist.\\nThey soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship \\"from the land of mist and snow\\"; the south wind that had initially led them from the land of ice now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is becalmed.\\nDay after day, day after day,\\n\\nWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\\n\\nAs idle as a painted ship\\n\\nUpon a painted ocean.\\n\\nWater, water, every where,\\n\\nAnd all the boards did shrink;\\n\\nWater, water, every where,\\n\\nNor any drop to drink.\\n\\nThe very deep did rot   Oh Christ!\\n\\nThat ever this should be.\\n\\nYea, slimy things did crawl with legs,\\n\\nUpon the slimy sea.\\nThe sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:\\nAh! Well a-day! What evil looks\\n\\nHad I from old and young!\\n\\nInstead of the cross, the albatross\\n\\nAbout my neck was hung.\\nEventually, the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are Death (a skeleton) and the \\"Night-mare Life-in-Death\\", a deathly-pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner's fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross.\\nOne by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew's corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces. Eventually, this stage of the mariner's curse is lifted after he appreciates the sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as \\"slimy things\\" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (\\"a spring of love gush'd from my heart, and I bless'd them unaware\\"); suddenly, as he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. The bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered preternaturally:\\nThe air is cut away before,\\n\\nAnd closes from behind.\\nFinally the mariner comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating.\\nOh! Dream of joy! Is this indeed\\n\\nThe light-house top I see?\\n\\nIs this the hill? Is this the kirk?\\n\\nIs this mine own countree?\\n\\nWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\\n\\nAnd I with sobs did pray \\n\\nO let me be awake, my God!\\n\\nOr let me sleep alway.\\nThe rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A hermit on the mainland had seen the approaching ship and had come to meet it with a pilot and his boy, in a boat. When they pull him from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot has a fit. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy goes crazy and laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, \\"The Devil knows how to row\\". As penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by guilt, is forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:\\nHe prayeth best, who loveth best\\n\\nAll things both great and small;\\n\\nFor the dear God who loveth us,\\n\\nHe made and loveth all.\\nAfter relaying the story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding guest returns home, and wakes the next morning \\"a sadder and a wiser man\\".\\nThe poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book's sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook.

The rate of firing of these cells and the modulation of this rate by catecholamines are controlled by if, an inward Na- and K-current that turns on at voltages more negative than -40 mV. The 'pacemaker' current if is also present in other types of cell where its ability to produce and modulate a depolarizing process may be useful. For example, in vertebrate photoreceptors if drives the depolarization that terminates the light-induced hyperpolarization. Currents similar to if are also found in hippocampal neurones and DRG neurones. The present report shows for the first time that the opening of single if-channels of low conductance (1 pS) can be resolved using a modification of the patch-clamp technique on isolated SA-node cells. Modulation of if by adrenaline is shown to be mediated by an increase in the probability of channel opening, whereas the single-channel amplitude remains unchanged. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Characterization of single pacemaker channels in cardiac sino-atrial node cells. option2: Coarctation of the aorta in children undergoing angioplasty: pretreatment and posttreatment MR imaging.","target":"Characterization of single pacemaker channels in cardiac sino-atrial node cells","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that characterized the single pacemaker channels in cardiac sino-atrial node cells.

At the time of the study insurance coverage was low and frontline workers were not noticeably modifying implementation arrangements. However, the underlying goal conflicts, resource scarcity, conditions of work and relationships between frontline workers and clients that fueled the exemptions policy implementation gaps were unchanged.

He then followed by asking me to show up his house and take a look at a something on his computer. I asked him what he wanted me to do, and he was like \\"it shouldn't be a problem for you, you are a smart guy who is about to graduate.. if you don't know you probably will figure it out with that Computer Science brain\\".

Which I didn't like at all, I felt like he was trying to get some type of written confirmation on me so he could use it somehow against me(not sure if that is how it even works). After I hung up, that part of asking me to text him that just angered me and I straight up told my mother I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really want to do it and midterms are coming up, and I have my own programming assignments I have to do. I was told that basically I am an asshole for not wanting to help family, and that he is my \\"Godfather\\" and that I should always help family because they're blood. I stood firm with my decision, but now I am being scolded. I'm wondering if I really am the asshole in this case because I wouldn't go to his house and do what he wanted me to do because he wasn't upfront, and probably use the other family members to pressure me  to work on this project he hunted at since Christmas for me to do to only be commissioned if it made him profit.\\n\\nAm I really the asshole because I didn't want to do this?

However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5]\\n\\nRural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.\\n\\nParagraph: Two rural communities from Jones county took different approaches on rural development as a means of adapting to increasing urbanization.

Mean difference between the raters was-0.02 cm/sec at rest and 0.45 cm/sec during exercise. Peak-to-peak variability was lowest in the mitral ring during rest (10-14%) and increased at peak exercise (15-21%). The proportion of segments eligible for analysis was 84% in the septum and 67% in the anterior wall during exercise. Thus, in patients with normal coronary arteries, tissue Doppler velocities decrease from base toward the apex during bicycle exercise. Interrater agreement is reduced during exercise and beat-to-beat variability is lowest in the mitral ring.","target":"yes","rationale":"The question asks whether the feasibility of using tissue Doppler velocities in stress echo during upright bicycle exercise can be determined. The answer states that the proportion of segments eligible for analysis was 84% in the septum and 67% in the anterior wall during exercise, meaning that it is feasible to determine tissue Doppler velocities during upright bicycle exercise.

Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship.

It has been proposed that emergency contraception be made available without a prescription. We undertook a study to learn how women might behave if given a supply of emergency contraceptive pills to keep at home.   \\n METHODS We assigned 553 women to be given a replaceable supply of hormonal emergency contraceptive pills to take home (the treatment group) and 530 women to use emergency contraception obtained by visiting a doctor (the control group). The frequency of use of emergency contraception, the use of other contraceptives, and the incidence of unwanted pregnancy were determined in both groups of women one year later.   \\n RESULTS The results for 549 women in the treatment group and 522 women in the control group were available for analysis. Three hundred seventy-nine of the women in the treatment group (69 percent) and 326 of the women in the control group (62 percent) contributed detailed information at follow-up. One hundred eighty of the women in the treatment group (47 percent) used emergency contraception at least once. Among those who returned the study questionnaire, 98 percent used emergency contraception correctly. There were no serious adverse effects. Eighty-seven women in the control group (27 percent) used emergency contraception at least once (P<0.001 for the comparison with the treatment group). The women in the treatment group were not more likely to use emergency contraception repeatedly. Their use of other methods of contraception was no different from that of the women in the control group. There were 18 unintended pregnancies in the treatment group and 25 in the control group (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 1.2).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Making emergency contraception more easily obtainable does no harm and may reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancies.","target":"True","rationale":"It is structured in multiple sections, including background, methods, results, and conclusions.

The angle of refraction depends on the index of refraction, as we saw in The Law of Refraction. We know that the index of refraction n depends on the medium. But for a given medium, n also depends on wavelength. (See Table 25.2. Note that, for a given medium, n increases as wavelength decreases and is greatest for violet light. Thus violet light is bent more than red light, as shown for a prism in Figure 25.23(b), and the light is dispersed into the same sequence of wavelengths as seen in Figure 25.21 and Figure 25.22. Making Connections: Dispersion Any type of wave can exhibit dispersion. Sound waves, all types of electromagnetic waves, and water waves can be dispersed according to wavelength. Dispersion occurs whenever the speed of propagation depends on wavelength, thus separating and spreading out various wavelengths. Dispersion may require special circumstances and can result in spectacular displays such as in the production of a rainbow. This is also true for sound, since all frequencies ordinarily travel at the same speed. If you listen to sound through a long tube, such as a vacuum cleaner hose, you can easily hear it is dispersed by interaction with the tube. Dispersion, in fact, can reveal a great deal about what the wave has encountered that disperses its wavelengths. The dispersion of electromagnetic radiation from outer space, for example, has revealed much about what exists between the stars—the so-called empty space.\\n\\n\\nQ: The angle of refraction depends on the index of what?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- frequency\\n\\n- vibration\\n\\n- reflection\\n\\n- refraction\\n\\nA:","target":"refraction","rationale":"The angle of refraction depends on the index of refraction.

The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the...","target":"British government","rationale":"The context of the passage describes how British authority in India was established and ultimately consolidated.

The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation.

W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish. The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play The Clansman, both by Thomas Dixon Jr., as well as Dixon's novel The Leopard's Spots. Griffith co-wrote the screenplay with Frank E. Woods, and co-produced the film with Harry Aitken. It was released on February 8, 1915.\\nContext: Thomas Dixon, Jr. was a former classmate of then-president Woodrow Wilson at Johns Hopkins University. Dixon arranged a screening of The Birth of a Nation at the White House for Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families, in one of the first ever screenings at the White House. Wilson was falsely reported to have said of the film, \\"It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true\\". Wilson's aide, Joseph Tumulty, denied the claims and said that \\"the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it.\\" Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film. After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the \\"unfortunate production\\".  Besides having the film screened at the White House, Dixon persuaded all nine justices of the Supreme Count to attend a screening of The Birth of a Nation as well as many members of Congress. With the help of the Navy Secretary, Josephus Daniels, Dixon was able to meet the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Edward Douglass White. Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film, but when Dixon told him it was the \\"true story\\" of Reconstruction and the Klan's role in \\"saving the South\\", White, recalling his youth in Louisiana, jumped to attention and said: \\"I was a member of the Klan, sir\\". With White agreeing to see the film, the rest of the Supreme Court followed. Dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by African-Americans that the film version of his books was projecting hatred against them, and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism. Dixon always vehemently denied having anti-black prejudices--despite the way his books promoted white supremacy--and stated: \\"My books are hard reading for a Negro, and yet the Negroes, in denouncing them, are unwittingly denouncing one of their greatest friends\\".  In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: \\"The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!\\" In a letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: \\"This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy\\". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had imposed segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. while reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.\\nQuestion: who was the president?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Woodrow Wilson","rationale":"The context is about President Woodrow Wilson watching The Birth of a Nation at the White House.\\nThere are also mentions of Dixon arranging to have the film screened at the Washington and other meetings with powerful men including some Supreme Court justices, which shows that he was trying to persuade people in power. In order for him to do this, it had to be when there was an existing administration that could make such decisions on policy matters as mentioned by Dixon's letter excerpts from May 1st 1915 and September 5th 1915 included in the context.  \\n\\n \\nTherefore, since no prior or later president were named in between all these events and conversations occurring during his presidency, we can deduce that President Woddow Wilson must be who was involved in these discussions.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given a date in \\"dd/mm/yyyy\\" format.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the last name of the person for whom lifestyle and art were intertwined?","target":"Bacon","rationale":"The question is asking for the last name of a person who was mentioned in the context.

The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.\\n\\nJackie and Mark are two friends who are spending a day at the beach.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","target":"Russia","rationale":"The most likely answer is Russia.\\n- The question mentions that Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers. This suggests that more hazardous chemicals were released into the ocean by the country using fertilizer compared to the other country which took precautions against pollution. \\n- Conventional farming often involves intensive use of chemical pesticides and artificial fertilizers, which can lead to water contamination if they are not stored properly or applied correctly. Since it is mentioned in the hint that many agricultural fertilizer chemicals enter oceans through rivers, we can infer that a greater quantity of these harmful substances would reach oceans via rivers from countries with poor soil management practices (such as those like Russia)."},{"source":"Exercise: Extract from the text the correct entity that \\"@placeholder\\" is referring to.\\n\\nBy Snejana Farberov For Mail Online A man walking down a Toronto street early Wednesday morning was stabbed in the heart after police say he accidentally bumped into two strangers while sending text messages on his phone.

Two postures required full support of body weight by the arms: arms up, hanging from a bar, and arms down with hands gripping parallel bars. Three involved muscles that flex and extend the trunk: a partial sit-up position while supine and nearly maximal spinal extension and flexion while standing. Changes at the inspiratory and expiratory volume extremes were recognized by having the subjects do two VC efforts: the first standing and the second in the posture in question while continuing to breathe on the spirometer. Control observations in which the second of a VC pair was performed in an unstressed posture allowed correction for the influence of rebreathing. The changes in corrected VC were small, the greatest being an average reduction of approximately 8% in the partial sit-up position. During full support of body weight by the arms, the VC was slightly increased due to a significant increase in the inspiratory extreme and no change in the expiratory extreme. Spinal extension produced small increases in lung volume at both extremes with no significant change in VC, whereas spinal flexion did not influence the upper extreme but did increase lung volume at the lower extreme. The changes are discussed in terms of trunk muscle action. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract mentions and provides numerical data for the vital capacity (VC) of the subjects in different postures.

Passage:After Louis XIV's marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain on 9 June 1660, Queen Anne turned her attention to the marriage of Philippe. He had previously been encouraged to court his older cousin the Duchess of Montpensier, eldest daughter of Gaston and his first wife Marie de Bourbon. Known as Mademoiselle at this time, she had an immense private fortune and had previously rejected suitors such as Charles II of England. Born in 1627, she was the sole heiress of her mother who died in childbirth. Mademoiselle declined the union, complaining that Philippe always stayed near his mother as if he was \\"like a child\\". Mademoiselle instead remained unmarried. Philippe would marry instead another first cousin, Princess Henrietta of England, youngest child of King Charles I of England and his wife Queen Henrietta Maria, who was Philippe's aunt and had taken refuge at the court of France after the birth of Princess Henrietta in 1644. They lived at the Palais Royal and at the Palais du Louvre. In 1660, after the restoration of the House of Stuart to the throne of England under her brother Charles II, Princess Henrietta returned to England to visit her sister, the Princess of Orange, who later caught smallpox and died. The French court officially asked for Henrietta's hand on behalf of Philippe on 22 November 1660 while she was in England. The couple signed their marriage contract at the Palais Royal on 30 March 1661. The ceremony took place the next day in the same building in front of select members of the court. The dowry promised was a huge 840,000 livres. Known as Henriette d'Angleterre in France, and Minette to her intimates, she was known officially as Madame and was ever popular with the court. Court gossip later said that the king was the father of Henrietta's first child. Henrietta's very open flirting is said to have caused a jealous Philippe to retaliate by beginning to flaunt his sexuality openly in a less than accepting era.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks whether Louis XIV's cousin had any siblings, which is mentioned directly in the passage as \\"Philippe would marry instead another first cousin, Princess Henrietta of England...\\".

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death.","target":"Lord Elgin","rationale":"The context mentions Lord Elgin and Queen Victoria, who both have very high positions in the British government. However, it can be inferred from the phrase \\"Very much like John Brown used to do\\", that at one point John Brown was a servant of Victoria's. In other words, he had a lower rank than her Majesty herself. Therefore, given the context we can infer that Lord Elgin is less highly ranked than Queen Victoria due to his position within the royal court being above servants but below royalty itself.\\nSo based on this information, in terms of their ranking relative to each other it would appear that:\\nQueen_Victoria > Lord_Elgin or equivalently (Lord_Elglin < Queen_Victoria)"},{"source":"Given the background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.\\n\\nand the situation: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: Would era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A?","target":"lower","rationale":"Given the background, we know that rainfall is important for weathering because it reacts with soil particles and causes chemical reactions to occur.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. \\n\\nQuestion: In which non-Albanian language-family has a raised to o?\\nI think \\"Illyrian\\" is a valid answer.

Over the past 8 years, it has been planted extensively in Australia and is now being exported to the United States and other Western countries. Recently, an explosion in incidence of contact dermatitis due to this plant has been seen. 24 patients who were suspected of being sensitive to it were patch tested to fresh plant and extracts with confirmation of sensitivity. A cross sensitivity to Toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing. The allergen in Toxicodendron, 3 pentadecylcatechol, is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol, present in Grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in Grevillea robusta. Patch testing in patients sensitive to Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions, thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' allergy. There is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the Grevillea genus, e.g., Grevillea robusta.

Bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest remaining members of the band, having been involved with Faith No More since its inception.\\n\\nChuck Mosley was replaced with singer Mike Patton in 1988. Patton, who was singing with his high school band, Mr. Bungle, was recruited at Martin's suggestion after he heard a demo of Mr. Bungle. According to Patton, he first met the band during a 1986 gig at \\"a pizza parlour\\" in his hometown of Eureka, California. Two weeks after joining Faith No More, he had written all the lyrics for the songs that would make up the Grammy award-nominated The Real Thing.  \\"Epic\\" was released in January 1990 and was a top 10 hit. The music video for \\"Epic\\" received extensive airplay on MTV in 1990, despite anger from animal rights activists for a slow motion shot of a fish flopping out of water. That same year, Faith No More performed at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on the 293rd episode of Saturday Night Live (December 1) \\"From Out of Nowhere\\" and \\"Falling to Pieces\\" saw releases as singles, and a cover of Black Sabbath's \\"War Pigs\\" was also produced for non-vinyl releases. In 1990, the band went on an extensive US tour, sending The Real Thing to Platinum status in Canada, the US, and South America. The album also had big sales numbers in Australia, UK, and the rest of Europe, pushing the total sales well above 4 million worldwide.  In February 1991, Faith No More released their only official live album, Live at the Brixton Academy. The album also included two previously unreleased studio tracks, \\"The Grade\\" and \\"The Cowboy Song\\". That same year, the band contributed a track for the motion picture soundtrack to Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey with the song \\"The Perfect Crime\\".

I can't find blue food--I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean yellow is lemon; orange is orange and red is cherry. Where is the blue food? \\"\\nWell, Carlin pretty much has it right--there's not no blue food, but there's certainly not a lot of it. Fresh-picked blueberries are blue, though they become purple when they are turned into jam. The blue in blueberries--like the purple in grapes and the red in tomatoes--is found in nature. But it isn't a hot color for food. People don't seem to prefer blue food. Some diet programs even suggest that those determined to lose weight should make their food blue.\\nEating, in part, begins with our eyes. Charles Spence--an experimental psychologist from Oxford University--points out that color can change our taste experience. Commonly, we consider red-colored foods up to 20% sweeter than they actually are; and green foods as being more sour. Spence suggests: human expectations may be influenced by our long history of watching - green fruits can become sweet as they grow up and turn red.\\nBut what about blue? Except blueberries, much of the blue food we see these days _ blue artificially. Food producers argue that artificial color doesn't do much harm to health.

It then says that humans don't seem to prefer blue foods and some diet plans even suggest making your food turn blue if you're trying to lose weight (which means people want their food less rather than more when it turns this unnatural shade).\\nIn conclusion: Blue is not a very popular color for foods."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer.

Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories.

Compared with the nonalkylated estrogen/norethindrone and the triphasic EE2/levonorgestrel formulations, the low-dose EE2/norethindrone combination resulted in small but significant increases in plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P less than 0.01), which seemed unfavorable from a clinical point of view.

However, when a person is already suffering from respiratory failure due to some cause such as an infection, then increasing morphine dose may help reduce breathing frequency by causing peripheral vasodilation and improving ventilation-perfusion ratio leading to improved oxygenation (see http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jbpneu/v32n4/en_0718-8605-jbpneu-32-04-00507a1b1b2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i10k11l12m13m14o15q16r17s18t19u20v21w22x23y24z25zz26aaa27bb28cc29ee30ff31gg32hh33ii34jj35kk36ll37mm38nn39oo40pp41qq42rr43ss44tt45uu46vv47ww48xx49yy50zz51aaa52bbb53cc54dd55ee56ff57gg58hh59ii60jj61kk62ll63mm64nn65oo66pp67qq68rr69ss70tt71uu72vv73ww74xx75yy76zz77aaa78bb79cc80dd81ee82ff83gg84hh85ii86jj87kk88ll89mm90nn91oo92pp93qq94rr95ss96tt97uu98vv99ww100xx101yy102zz103aaa104bb105cc106dd107ee108ff109gg110hh111ii112jj113kk114ll115mm116nn117oo118pp119qq120rr121ss122tt123uu124vv125ww126xx127yy128zz129aaa130bb131cc132dd133ee134ff135gg136hh137ii138jj139kk140ll141mm142nn143oo144pp145qq146rr147ss148tt149uu150vv151ww152xx153yy154zz155aaa156bb157cc158dd159ee160ff161gg162hh163ii164jj165kk166ll167mm168nn169oo170pp171qq172rr173ss174tt175uu176vv177ww178xx179yy180zz181aa182ab183ac184ad185ae186af187ag188ah189ai190aj191ak192al193am194an195ao196ap197aq198ar199as200at201au202av203aw204ax205ay206az207ba208ca209cb210fc211gc212hc213ic214jc215kc216lc217mc218nc219oc220pc221qc222rc223sc224tc225uc226vc227wc228xc229yc230zc231a232b233d234e235g236h237i238j239l240m241o242p243q244r245s246t247v248w249x250y251z252a253ap254cp255dp256ep257fp258gp259hp260ip261jp262kp263lp264mp265np266op267rp268tp269up270yp271yp272yp273yp274yp275yp276ys277ys278ys279ys280yt281yu282yv283yx284yz285za286zb287zd288ze289zl290zn291zo292zx293zy294zza295zza296zza297zza298zza299zzle300zzle301zzle302zzy303zzy304zzy305zzy306zzy307zzy308zzo309zzo310zzo311zzo312zzo313zzo314zzo315zzo316zzo317zzo318zzi319zzi320zzi321zzi322zzi323zzi324zzi325zzi326zi327zi328zi329zi330zi331zi332zi333xi334xi335xi336xi337xi338xi339xa340xa341xa342xb343xb344xb345xb346xb347wb348wb349wb350wa351wa352wa353wa354wn355wn356wn357wn358wt359wt360ws361ws362wi363wi364wh"},{"source":"In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania.\\nOfficially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump.

Living things make more organisms like themselves. Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will create more life.

Sexual reproduction involves two parents and the fusion of gametes , haploid sex cells from each parent. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically unique and increases genetic variation within a species. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.\\n\\n- A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.\\n\\n- Gioele Dix , a pseudonym of his name David Ottolenghi ( born January 3 , 1956 ) is an Italian actor and comedian of Jewish descent .\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'italy'.","target":"gioele dix","rationale":"The paragraphs above describe how the comedian, Gioele Dix is an Italian actor and comedian.\\nSo, the answer is gioele dix"},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true:\\n\\nSafe is a 2012 American action crime thriller film written and directed by Boaz Yakin and starring Jason Statham, Chris Sarandon, Robert John Burke and James Hong.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model.

A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s.\\nIn the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \\"Tender Trio\\" â Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose â rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off.

Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their habitat—whether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river—will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats (habitats generally refer to the part of the ecosystem required by a particular species) accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra’s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 21.8). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A 5-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1 percent. Much loss (2.4 percent) occurred in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction. These losses certainly also represent the extinction of species unique to those areas.\\n\\n\\nQ: The part of the ecosystem required by a particular species is endangered when human activity threatens loss of what?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- primary producers\\n\\n- primary speciation\\n\\n- biodiversity\\n\\n- habitat\\n\\nA:","target":"habitat","rationale":"The excerpt mentions species whose habitat has been destroyed or is being threatened by human activity.

(In early 1976, before the band had played gigs at any venues, Vincent O'Neill left the band; being replaced by his younger brother Damian.)  Beginning in February 1976 the group, at this stage still unnamed, began playing gigs at various minor local venues, including schools, parish halls and Scout huts, where the band's lead singer, Feargal Sharkey, was a local Scout leader. Sharkey was also responsible for giving the band their first name: at the introduction to a gig at Saint Joseph's Secondary School in Derry on 16 March 1976, Feargal Sharkey was asked the name of the band and quickly replied \\"The Hot Rods\\".

It encompassed the old Cape Colony, and had Cape Town as its capital. Following the end of the Apartheid era, the Cape Province was split up to form the new Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces.\\n\\n- Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.\\n\\n- Durbanville is a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa, part of the greater City of Cape Town metropolitan area. Durbanville is a rural residential suburb on the northern outskirts of the metropolis and is surrounded by farms producing wine and wheat.\\n\\n- A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.\\n\\n- The Northern Cape is the largest and most sparsely populated province of South Africa. It was created in 1994 when the Cape Province was split up. Its capital is Kimberley. It includes the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, part of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, an international park shared with Botswana. It also includes the Augrabies Falls and the diamond mining regions in Kimberley and Alexander Bay. The Namaqualand region in the west is famous for its Namaqualand daisies. The southern towns of De Aar and Colesberg, in the Great Karoo, are major transport nodes between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. In the northeast, Kuruman is famous as a mission station and also for its \\"eye\\". The Orange River flows through the province, forming the borders with the Free State in the southeast and with Namibia to the northwest. The river is also used to irrigate the many vineyards in the arid region near Upington.\\n\\n- Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

Landing place and home of the 1820 settlers, the central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the Xhosa people. This region is the birthplace of many prominent South African politicians, such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, Chris Hani, Thabo Mbeki, Steve Biko, Bantu Holomisa and Charles Coghlan.\\n\\n- De facto is a Latin expression that means \\"in fact, in reality, in actual existence, force, or possession, as a matter of fact\\" (literally \\"of fact\\").

How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content.

This time it was Dona Catarina, a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve. Pedro Lopes de Sousa led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops , 15,400 native Lascarin allies, 47 elephants used as pack animals, and the remainder Badaga mercenaries from India and coolie labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended mountain passes. The Portuguese stormed the pass at Balana with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital Kandy without resistance, finding it abandoned by King Vimaladharmasuriya I. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband . Vimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in guerilla tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that Jayavira Bandara Mudali, one of the Lascarin chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward.

The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.","target":"Dan","rationale":"Jim learned about fuels, which are used to power engines.

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born.\\nThe Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head.

Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence.

They primarily live in the Arab states in Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and western Indian Ocean islands.\\n\\nProto-Arabic, or Ancient North Arabian, texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of epigraphic south Arabian musnad script, including the 8th century BCE Hasaean inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE Lihyanite texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the Thamudic texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and Sinai (not in reality connected with Thamud).  The Nabataeans were nomadic who moved into territory vacated by the Edomites - Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in Aramaic, but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The Nabataean alphabet was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by Safaitic inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in Nabataean inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw reveal a dialect no longer considered proto-Arabic, but pre-classical Arabic. Five Syriac inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at Sumatar Harabesi, one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.  Arabs arrived in the Palmyra in the late first millennium BCE. The soldiers of the sheikh Zabdibel, who aided the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia (217 BCE), were described as Arabs; Zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as Palmyrenes in the texts, but the name \\"Zabdibel\\" is a Palmyrene name leading to the conclusion that the sheikh hailed from Palmyra. Palmyra was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate after its 634 capture by the Arab general Khalid ibn al-Walid, who took the city on his way to Damascus; an 18-day march by his army through the Syrian Desert from Mesopotamia. By then Palmyra was limited to the Diocletian camp. After the conquest, the city became part of Homs Province.  Palmyra prospered as part of the Umayyad Caliphate, and its population grew. It was a key stop on the East-West trade route, with a large souq (Arabic: suwq, market), built by the Umayyads, who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a mosque. During this period, Palmyra was a stronghold of the Banu Kalb tribe. After being defeated by Marwan II during a civil war in the caliphate, Umayyad contender Sulayman ibn Hisham fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra, but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb leader al-Abrash al-Kalbi in 745. That year, Marwan ordered the city's walls demolished. In 750 a revolt, led by Majza'a ibn al-Kawthar and Umayyad pretender Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, against the new Abbasid Caliphate swept across Syria; the tribes in Palmyra supported the rebels. After his defeat Abu Muhammad took refuge in the city, which withstood an Abbasid assault long enough to allow him to escape.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Arabs","rationale":"The given text is about the Arabs.\\nIt describes their origins, arrival in Palmyra and mentions some of the prominent Arabs from that time period."},{"source":"Here is a question about this article: In 1970, the New Haven Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut history.

However, in vitro signal transduction pathway(s) utilized by Reg IV are not yet known.', 'To determine the signaling pathway(s) responsive to Reg IV, we examined the effects of purified recombinant human Reg IV (rhR4) on HCT116 and HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Addition of rhR4 to cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in cell number similar to that observed after treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). In addition, rhR4 treatment resulted in rapid phosphorylation of EGF receptor at Tyr992 and Tyr1068 and Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Using luciferase reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that Reg IV signaling through EGF receptor and Akt results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed quantitative increases in c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and FosB expression associated with increased AP-1 activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further revealed significant increases in AP-1 binding activity in rhR4-treated cells, with increased supershift in the presence of antibodies to JunB, JunD, and FosB.

According to General Maxwell Taylor, \\"Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before.\\" Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was \\"somber and shaken\\". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was \\"particularly abhorrent\\" and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that \\"It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam.\\" When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied \\"No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country.\\"Kennedy's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration. Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable, assassination was always a possibility. Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America.  When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia.  He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family.  Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture.  Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.  This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot.  Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F.

In our country, Pakistan, there are approximately 75 languages, from which Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi are common, excluding English. So today I found two women speaking two different languages. For example: Speaker 1 has Urdu as their mother tongue. Speaker 2 has Sindhi as their mother tongue. Speaker 1 and 2 spoke their own mother tongue, which are different (Urdu and Sindhi) but both can understand each other's language. I thought that this is known as \\"intermingling conversation,\\" or a \\"code switching.\\" In my opinion, we can't use such words because code-switching refers \\"shifting completely to the other language for a word, a phrase or sentence, and then revert back to the base language.\\" Example sentences: They were in a bus and had [adjective] conversation. They were in a bus and had [noun or noun-phrase for such conversation]. I agree that the question (which is suspected as a duplicate one to this question) is really a duplicate, but its single answer still doesn't satisfy all. In that question, the phrase \\"bilingual dialogue\\" was suggested, which I (and others may) think that this refers to the code switching as well, which I don't want here. Some words confuse the readers which sense do they mean. I would also love to quote the comment of @Lambie regarding the term \\"bilingual\\" over here: \\"Bilingual refers to one person. Not two people each of whom has a passive knowledge of the other's language but do not speak it well enough to use it actively.\\" \\nAnswer: I am a translator and interpreter and speak four languages (I am quadri-lingual, in fact). There is no specific term for this. And it's certainly not bilingual. If this refers to two people, it just means they at least passively know each other languages but actively only use their own. They each have a passive knowledge of the other's language, otherwise they'd be speaking one or the other. They are passive \\"speakers\\" of a language. passive speaker Passive knowledge means you can understand a language or read a language but cannot actively speak it with any confidence. For example, in my case, I speak three Romance languages but do not actively speak Italian. However, my passive knowledge of Italian is very good so I can actually carry on a conversation with an Italian speaker if they can understand English. (In fact, I can carry on a simple conversation but can understand an advanced one passively.) But beware: In the world of translation and interpretation, a passive language has a more technical meaning: it means the language from which a translator or interpreter is working. This is often symbolized as: German>English, English>Chinese. If a person is bilingual (which is not as frequent as one might imagine), this is signified like this: English<>Chinese. Here is a blog post about this issue as regards active and passive vocabulary in language learning, though it applies to monolinguals as well. passive and active vocabulary I often speak English to my husband and he responds in Spanish. We have a conversation in two languages. Bilingual means an individual can speak two languages equally well, though there are different levels of bilingualism. And, if I hear someone say: \\"We had a bilingual conversation.\\" I would understand that each of the speakers spoke two languages and both switched back and forth between those two languages without causing a break in their conversation due to lack of understanding. As for codes, mixing and switching them is not \\"inter-lingual\\". A speaker code switches within her or his own language. Reading over the answers, I had to laugh when thinking about having a conversation with someone where one person uses a different language than the other and they understand each other. Of course, they understand each other, otherwise it would not be a conversation, would it? And, I daresay that mutual intelligibility is an issue that does not involve more than one language necessarily. Who hasn't had a conversation with eggheads in a monolingual situation where there was no \\"mutual intelligibility\\" at all? And for the record, the idea that a Spanish speaker can understand a Portuguese speaker is a very specious idea. The fact much in the two languages is very similar does not account for the parts that are completely different. And this can lead to major misunderstandings and comical situations. (I just can't think of an example at the moment, as I write.) The mutual intelligibility factor is true only to a limited extent.","target":"no","rationale":"The answer is not acceptable because it does not provide a single specific term for the given question and contains several terms for the same thing, which are confusing."},{"source":"In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\", so\\".

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

They'll throw down cash, half of what they owe, and then people like me, who don't drink, end up paying even more.

In the first quarter the Jets trailed early as kicker Robbie Gould got a 37-yard field goal, followed by Matt Forte getting a 22-yard TD run. The Jets pulled ahead with RB Shonn Greene getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by CB Dwight Lowery returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, followed by RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 3-yard TD run letting the Jets lead 21-10. The lead was narrowed as QB Jay Cutler scrambled 2 yards for a touchdown, but was soon extended as kicker Nick Folk made a 26-yard field goal. They trailed again with Cutler completing a 40 and a 25-yard TD pass to wide receivers Devin Hester and Johnny Knox respectively, but soon were able to tie the game with QB Mark Sanchez throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes. The Bears escaped the tie with Cutler finding Knox again on a 26-yard TD pass. The Jets tried to come back, but only came away with a 34-yard field goal from Folk. When the Jets got the ball back, Sanchez threw a pass intended for Holmes, only to be intercepted by safety Chris Harris with 0:58 to go. With the loss, the Jets fell to 10-5, but clinched a playoff berth when the Jaguars lost to the Redskins..\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many more yards of touchdowns did Jay Cutler have over Mark Sanchez?","target":"68","rationale":"In order to find out how many more yards of touchdowns Jay Cutler had over Mark Sanchez, we first have to identify the number of yards for each quarterback. For Jay Cutler, it is mentioned that he completed a 40 and 25 yard touchdown pass respectively. Therefore his total would be 65 + 25 = 90 yards in total for two passes. On the other hand, for Mark Sanchez, it is stated that he threw 23-yard TD pass only once in this game; therefore his total would be 23. Since 90 - 23 = 67 more yards are given by Cutler than those passed by Sanchez (in terms of touchdowns), we conclude that 68 more yard was obtained from him as compared with what was gained from Sanchez's passing games when they played against Bears on December 26th 2010"},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the union of two given sets.

Forsberg played minor hockey alongside boyhood friend Markus Naslund, who was also born in Ornskoldsvik.

Forsberg played his first game back with the Avalanche in Nationwide Arena against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 11 February. He was in the starting lineup at left wing, a departure from his natural center, with 2001 Stanley Cup-winning teammate Milan Hejduk, as well as Matt Duchene. In the two road games he played in, Forsberg was on the ice for 17 minutes and 38 seconds, with zero points and a -4 plus-minus rating. The Avalanche lost both games.

K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. First mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" the Ministry makes its first proper appearance in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\". Throughout the books, it is generally depicted as either corrupt, incompetent, or both, with its high officials blind to actual events and dangers. It reaches a nadir of corruption before being effectively taken over by Lord Voldemort. At the end of the final book, following Voldemort's death, Kingsley Shacklebolt takes over the ministry, changing it for the better. By the time of \\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\\", Hermione Granger is the Minister for Magic.\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters and the Power of Love , or Power of Love , is the third studio album by indie rock band Harry and the Potters , released on July 4 , 2006 . The album was primarily inspired by the sixth novel in the Harry Potter book series .\\n\\n- Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.\\n\\n- Lord Voldemort (or in the films) (born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character and the central antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of \\"Harry Potter\\" novels. Voldemort first appeared in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\", which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", where he is only mentioned.\\n\\n- A story arc is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a narrative arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.\\n\\n- Ronald Bilius \\"Ron\\" Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family, who reside in \\"The Burrow\\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of the Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series.\\n\\n- In the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series, a Muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family. Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood in them. It differs from the term \\"Squib\\", which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power/ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive term \\"mudblood\\"), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. The equivalent term used by the in-universe magic community of America is No-Maj.\\n\\n- Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. \\n\\n- Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles.\\n\\n- Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.\\n\\n- Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters are an American rock band known for spawning the genre of wizard rock. Founded in Norwood, Massachusetts in 2002, the group is primarily composed of brothers Joe and Paul DeGeorge, who both perform under the persona of the title character from the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series. Harry and the Potters are known for their elaborate live performances, and have developed a cult following within the \\"Harry Potter\\" fandom.\\n\\n- A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.\\n\\n- Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.\\n\\n- Joanne \\"Jo\\" Rowling, (born 31 July 1965), pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist, screenwriter and film producer best known as the author of the \\"Harry Potter\\" fantasy series. The books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies. They have become the best-selling book series in history and been the basis for a series of films over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Wizard rock (sometimes shortened as Wrock) is a genre of rock music that developed between 2002 and 2004 in the United States. Wizard rock bands are characterized by their performances and humorous songs about the \\"Harry Potter\\" universe. Wizard rock initially started in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally.\\n\\n\\n\\n'harry and the potters and the power of love' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - alternative rock\\n - art\\n - book\\n - book series\\n - britpop\\n - chronicle\\n - comic\\n - family\\n - fantasy\\n - fashion\\n - genre\\n - government\\n - grunge\\n - independent music\\n - indie pop\\n - indie rock\\n - law\\n - music\\n - musical\\n - new wave\\n - play\\n - rock\\n - rock music\\n - science\\n - shoegazing\\n - supernatural\\n - television\\n - television series\\n - universe\\n - wizard rock","target":"wizard rock","rationale":"wizard rock is the right answer because Harry and Potters was a wizard rock band."},{"source":"Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them.

Passage:The first archaeological investigation of the site was carried out in 1964. In that year, the site was noted during an archaeological survey of the region directed by Maurits N. van Loon of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and a small sounding was made. In 1965, a more extensive excavation was carried out, again under the direction of Van Loon. Between 1971 and 1974, work on the site was resumed by a team of the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) directed by Jacques Cauvin. All excavations were part of the larger international – and eventually UNESCO-coordinated – effort to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible in the area that would be flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam, which was being built at that time. The filling of Lake Assad eventually led to the flooding of Mureybet in 1976. Although the site is now submerged and no longer accessible, the material that has been retrieved during the excavations continues to generate new research. This material is currently stored at the National Museum of Aleppo and the Institute de Préhistoire Orientale in Jalès-Berrias in France.\\n Links: a. Reservoir b.

On Washington's admission as a state on November 11, 1889, he became its inaugural governor, serving one term, stepping down in 1893 through failing health.\\n\\n- A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected.

He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\".

At this point, SIL was looking over our shoulder and said that she liked pictures 1 and 3, but really hated 4 and 5 because it looked like she had a double chin (she was leaning over to kiss niece on the head and it definitely gives that illusion). \\n\\nWell, the problem is that picture number 5 is the only one where my mom looks amazing. My mom is really camera shy and tends to be tense until the very end. It's the only photo where she is smiling and looking like her usual happy, beautiful self. Everyone else looks good and it's only my SIL who is in an unflattering position. So I said I'd think about it, but then later posted that photo on Facebook and got that one printed for my parents' house, as well as to send to my brother. I do a lot of post-processing work and print on my own dime, so it's a lot of work for me.\\n\\nWell, now my brother says ITA because there were lots of photos that I could have used but I went with one of the ones his wife asked me not to use. Which A) I didn't actually ask her opinion and B) she just looks like she has a little double chin, it's not the end of the world. She's kissing her daughter, it's sweet. But my brother says that it was niece's birthday photo and an important occasion for him and his wife, so SIL's opinion should have been taken into consideration more than usual and that she mattered more than my mom in the pic. \\n\\nIf it matters, we all only get together a few times a year because we all live in different places so it's not like we get the chance for large family photos a lot.","target":"yes","rationale":"After gathering a group of family members for photos, the author has some of the photos printed and posted on Facebook.

In practice, when the sample size is small compared to the number of variables, the empirical estimate is known to be very unstable. Here, we propose a novel covariance estimator based on the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM). Our estimator can be considered as a non-linear extension of standard factor models with readily interpretable parameters reminiscent of market betas. Furthermore, our Bayesian treatment naturally shrinks the sample covariance matrix towards a more structured matrix given by the prior and thereby systematically reduces estimation errors. Finally, we discuss some financial applications of the GP-LVM model.","target":"Covariance matrix estimation of financial assets with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nCovariance matrix estimation of financial assets with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models"},{"source":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. \\n\\nWhich country used fewer alternative energy sources?\\n\\nTwo countries used different fuels as power sources for their activities. Alsacia used fossil fuels, while Lorena devised more advanced energy storage devices, therefore relying on electricity.\\n\\nHint: There is worldwide concern about the relationship between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty.\\nApparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained.\\nThe nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform.
