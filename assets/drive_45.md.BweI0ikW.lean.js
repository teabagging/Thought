Passage:Commelina hockii is an herbaceous plant in the dayflower family found primarily in Central Africa, from southwestern Tanzania in the east, west through the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, and possibly extending further west to Angola. The species' distinctive features include its long, tapering spathes with unfused margins, its white flowers, and its many-flowered lower cymes. It can be found in grasslands and Brachystegia-dominated woodland. It is fairly unusual among Commelina species in having variation in the color of the antherodes (i.e. non-functional anthers), with some individuals having entirely yellow antherodes, while others contain a dark spot in the center. Also, it is one of the only Commelina species known to leave a papery residue of dried fluid inside its spathes; normally only fused-spathe species are known to produce this substance. Only one specimen from Angola resembles this species, but it has blue flowers, suggesting it may be a poorly understood and as-yet undescribed separate species. Commelina hockii is probably closely related to Commelina kituloensis, which shares a similar fruit type, the same tufted perennial habit, similar large spathes with dried fluid substance, and equally numerously flowered inflorescences. That species differs in having purplish flowers, hairy leaves, shorter spathes, and a preference for high altitude grassland.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks for the country with the largest population, which is not mentioned in the passage.

Passage:During the following off-season in 2015, UBC Athletics would draw the Dinos head coach, Blake Nill away from the Calgary Dinos in what was the most high profile coaching change that year. Nill's impact was immediate as he was able to recruit quarterback Michael O'Connor, who was the ranked the sixth best quarterback by ESPN among the 2014 recruiting class. The Thunderbirds achieved a turnaround in Nill's debut season at the UBC helm to finish the 2015 regular season with a 6–2 record, placing second in the CWUAA standings. During the ensuing post-season drive of three straight single-elimination playoff games on the road, UBC upset the heavily favoured Calgary Dinos in the Hardy Cup game at Calgary; then defeated the St. Francis Xavier X-Men to earn its historical first Uteck Bowl victory at Antigonish, to advance to the national title game. In the 51st Vanier Cup championship, the Thunderbirds narrowly defeated the defending CIS champion Montreal Carabins, by scoring the game's last possession field goal to end the fourth quarter.

The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \\"Cathar antipope\\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.\\nThe first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.\\nThe material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service.

Finally, agreement was reached on a design, and on 9 June 1891 the two men signed the contract.Nansen wanted the ship in one year; he was eager to get away before anyone else could adopt his ideas and forestall him.  The ship's most significant external feature was the roundness of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could get a grip. Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would \\"slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice\\".  To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28 inches (60–70 cm), increasing to around 48 inches (1.25 metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull.\\nThe ship was rigged as a three-masted schooner, with a total sail area of 6,000 square feet (560 m2). Its auxiliary engine of 220 horse-power was capable of speeds up to 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph). However, speed and sailing qualities were secondary to the requirement of providing a safe and warm stronghold for Nansen and his crew during a drift that might extend for several years, so particular attention was paid to the insulation of the living quarters. At around 400 gross register tonnage, the ship was considerably larger than Nansen had first anticipated, with an overall length of 128 feet (39 m) and a breadth of...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the name of the vessel with an auxiliary engine of 220 horse-power was capable of speeds up to 7 knots?","target":"Fram","rationale":"The passage states that Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect.

Concrete itself has greater friction than painted concrete because it has a rougher texture when compared with its smoother counterpart. This means that rolling hand balls on plain concrete results in more heat being produced by both objects due to increased friction (the difference can be felt using hands). \\nSo \\"plain concrete\\" must produce less stickiness then \\"painted concrete\\"."},{"source":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the 1950s,[10] a 20-year-old woman[10] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane after she is blamed for the death of her younger sister.

But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: What desert did the author say was a fixture at Easter tables around Italy?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. sugar cookies\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC. cotton candy\\n\\nD. colomba","target":"D","rationale":"The context of the passage states that Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy.

POST : Some backstory:\\n              My brother came to live with me when he was 16 because he dropped out and left home. While with me he got his GED and babysat for me while me and my husband worked in exchange for room and board. This lasted until he started seeing this woman that he worked with and she introduced him an IV substance. Brother started stealing from me and when I began finding his paraphernalia laying around I told him its her and the drugs, or your family and a place to live. I even offered to drive him to and from NA or rehab or whatever he wanted to do. He left the next day, with our rent money. Started sneaking into our shed and stealing things at night. I have even found him camping on our property. I told him to go away and not come back until he was clean since he wouldn't get help. Fast forward a year or so, I take him and this woman in because they are going to meetings and seem to be on the right track. Until one day I get text from brother about his girlfriends teddy bear. How she left it behind and not to let anything happen to it because it was a gift yadda yadda... Well teddy had a busted seam in the back and their paraphernalia was stuffed inside. I ditched teddy in a dumpster and reamed him for putting me at risk by having it in my vehicle while I was driving. They stay another 2 weeks until they can find a place but the night after they left (I work nights) they busted into my house and cleaned me out. Ps4, xbox1, a laptop, the list goes on. He even stole the battery from my emergency vehicle. I don't have proof but I know it was him. Whenever we would hang out cell phones would go missing etc. It sucked. So I cut him out completely. Fast forward to now. He moved out of town with family after being incarcerated for 6 months, is working a job, seems clean, girlfriend is in rehab. He seems to be getting it together and has been reaching out (for favors). I haven't responded and I don't want to. I'm not ready. I haven't forgiven him yet and he hasn't even apologised.

Frusciante has an active solo career, having released eleven solo albums and five EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from experimental rock and ambient music to new wave and electronica.\\n\\nFrusciante was born in Queens, New York, on March 5, 1970. His father, John Sr., is a Juilliard-trained pianist, and his mother Gail was a promising vocalist who gave up her career to be a stay-at-home mother. Frusciante's family moved to Tucson, Arizona, and then Florida, where his father served as a Broward County judge until October 2010. His parents separated, and he and his mother moved to Santa Monica, California. Frusciante is of Italian descent; his paternal great-grandfather Generoso Frusciante emigrated from Benevento.  A year later, Frusciante and his mother moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new stepfather who, he says, \\"really supported me and made me feel good about being an artist.\\" Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.  Frusciante began studying guitarists like Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour and Jimi Hendrix at eleven. He discovered Frank Zappa, whose work he would study for hours. Frusciante first heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers around 1984 when his guitar instructor was auditioning as a guitarist for that band. He dropped out of high school at sixteen with the permission of his parents and completion of a proficiency test. With their support, he moved to Los Angeles to develop his musicianship.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"planet B","rationale":"The paragraph states that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A, and the hint explains how the presence of this gas could contribute to heat.

After graduating from Cornell, Natal became a key figure in a series of strikes held at the University of Puerto Rico in protest of a quota being introduced to the students.

Passage 1:The Ibicaba Farm (in Portuguese: Fazenda Ibicaba) is one of the most known farms of Brazil. Established in 1817 by senator Nicolau Vergueiro, it was widely known as one of the most macabre symbols of the slavery in the state of São Paulo. Afterwards, it has become the pioneer in the replacement of the African enslaved by the European immigrants' labour and in the use of the steam engine, cart and plough. The Ibicaba has also served as a military headquarters during the War of the Triple Alliance, receiving the Emperor Dom Pedro II, the princess Isabel and the count Gaston of Eu. In the 19th century, it was the stage to the revolt of the European immigrants, led by Thomaz Davatz, who achieved to show the European authorities the conditions in which their former citizens lived in Brazil. By 1882, the Italian immigration to Brazil grew significantly, encouraging the aftermost massive immigrations of Italians to the whole state of São Paulo, including its capital. In 1890, the farm was bought by the Levy family, and then reduced thanks to the allotment and inheritance conditions. Since the 1990s, it's being used as a museum and tourist site.\\n Passage 2:In 1774 Carroll founded St. John the Evangelist Parish at Forest Glen (Silver Spring) on land that belonged to his mother. In 1776, the Continental Congress asked Carroll, along with his cousin, delegate Charles Carroll, fellow Marylander Samuel Chase (1741–1811), and Benjamin Franklin (1705/06–1790), to travel north to Montreal in the Saint Lawrence River Valley to try to persuade the French Canadian-majority Province of Quebec to join the Revolution with the lower Thirteen Colonies. The French Canadians had been forced to cede control of their territory in 1763 to the occupying British Army, which won the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in North America. The Quebec Act of 1774 allowed French Canadians to keep their language, their religion, and much of their law. The group was unsuccessful, but Carroll became known to other early founders of the United States Republic. Snubbed by the local clergy on the orders of Jean-Olivier Briand, Bishop of Quebec, Carroll took an early opportunity to accompany the ailing Franklin back to the colonial capital at Philadelphia.\\n Passage 3:The band was formed in November 1977 by former Džentlmeni, Fleš and Dah member Zlatimir Zlatko Manojlović.

After Zdenko Pomper (a former Dah member) replaced Janković on bass guitar, the band released its debut album Čovek (A Man) in 1978, through ZKP RTLJ.

Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day).

Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as \\"avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded\\". John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.\\"?","target":"How did John treat debts owed to him differently?","rationale":"The passage talks about how John would treat debts owed to him differently.

To afford an appeal to get her daughter back, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a strip club in Miami. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and becomes infatuated with Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice.

Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak English well until kindergarten, having been raised with Croatian as his mother tongue. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the Vancouver Canucks and Atlanta Flames; after watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, Wayne Gretzky.\\n\\nSakic was drafted 15th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Rather than make the immediate jump, he told the Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987-88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL. He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the Hartford Whalers and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender Sean Burke of the New Jersey Devils. During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, Alain Cote. While considered a front-runner for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury that forced him to miss 10 games in December and the resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award. He would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games.  In 1989-90, his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch his number back to his familiar #19 (Alain Cote had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At the start of the next season, 1990-91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991-92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, \\"We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game.\\" Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.  Starting with the 1992-93 season, Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise. Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the 2000-01 Colorado Avalanche team). Sakic reached the 100-point plateau, the third time he did so in five years, by scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season, and added another six points in the playoffs. In the shortened 1994-95, after the 1994-95 NHL lockout, Sakic was eight points behind Jaromir Jagr for the scoring title with a fourth-place finish, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first since the 1985-86 season.  Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada at seven international competitions. After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the 1988 World Junior Championship. His next tournament was the 1991 World Championships, where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games. He tried out for the 1991 Canadian Canada Cup team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength. Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience \\"a complete waste of time.\\"  Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success. During the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, he played only a minor role in Canada's second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.  Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, after the event allowed NHL players to compete for the first time. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games, as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. Sakic's second Olympic appearance came in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Led by his strong play, the Canadian team played their way to the gold medal match against Team USA, where Sakic had four points and helped the team win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the Triple Gold Club. Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he scored six points in six games.  On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of Team Canada for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall. Sakic finished the tournament with three points.  After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic returned to the Avalanche to work in their front office. He was named an executive advisor and alternate governor for the team, effective at the end of the 2010-11 season. In his role as an advisor, Sakic would advise the team in hockey-related matters, and as an alternate governor, would represent the team at Board of Governors meetings.  On June 26, 2012, Sakic was selected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2012, along with Mats Sundin, Pavel Bure and Adam Oates. Sakic was the only member of his class who won the Stanley Cup during his career.  On May 10, 2013, the Avalanche promoted Sakic to Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations. In this expanded role, Sakic has the final say on all matters regarding hockey personnel. During Patrick Roy's time as head coach, they shared most of the duties normally held by a general manager. General Manager Greg Sherman remained in his post, but served mainly in an advisory role to Roy and Sakic. This de facto arrangement was formalized the following season, when Sakic was formally named general manager and Sherman was demoted to assistant general manager.  Apart from his two years away from hockey, Sakic has spent almost three decades with the Nordiques/Avalanche organization as either a player or executive.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did he do after he stopped playing hockey?","target":"After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family.","rationale":"After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family.\\nIn 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic returned to the Avalanche to work in their front office.

Repeated measures ANOVA was applied to analyse HRQOL evolution in 'fit' and 'vulnerable' patients, defined by G-8.

Fit patients maintained a relatively acceptable long-term HRQOL, whilst vulnerable patients showed significantly lower median health states. The difference remained apparent at 36 months. Vulnerability, as classified by G-8 or CGA, came forward as independent predictor for lower EQ-5D index scores. After consideration of confounders, a significantly lower survival was observed in patients defined vulnerable according to G-8, compared to fit patients. A similar trend was seen based on CGA.

If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer.

At the start of the session, I admit I was skeptical. The only reason I was doing it is because it was gifted to me; it wasn't something I would have sought out myself. While I've always been a person who believe in spirits and energy living beyond death, someone actually communicating in real time with someone I'd lost was not something I fully believed in.

Without going into too much detail, I can say that within the first few minutes of the conversation, I was sure I was speaking to my friend. One thing that the medium said caused me to burst into tears—my friend knew of the symbol we had created for her after her death. I was also finally given some sort of confirmation that my friend was happier where she was. She said that I didn't need to worry about her, and I was told that she spends time with me sometimes. It's been 3 years since she died, but nothing gave me more relief than this session did. It doesn't make the pain of the death go away, but it absolutely helped with the healing process.

In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work.

One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.In contrast to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller than those of the early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.\\nThe Western Chalukya art evolved in two phases, the first lasting approximately a quarter of a century and the second from the beginning of 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 CE. During the first phase, temples were built in the Aihole-Banashankari-Mahakuta region (situated in the early Chalukya heartland) and Ron in the Gadag district. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the Gulbarga district and Gokak in the Belgaum district. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the Rashtrakuta temples in Kuknur in the Koppal district and Mudhol in the Bijapur district, evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty. The mature and latter phase reached its peak at Lakkundi (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court. From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the Tungabhadra River. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the Davangere district, and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the Bellary district.Influences of Western Chalukya...","target":"Kakatiya","rationale":"The paragraph states that the architectural style of the Western Chalukya dynasty originated from an older dravida style.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.\\n\\nKat and Joe were into vegetable gardening.

Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there.

After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village.\\nOne morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought.

Histologically, fibrous dysplasia is characterized by the production of fibrous tissue accompanied by the deposition of ectopic type I collagen and other bone-associated extracellular matrix proteins, as well as by irregular woven intramembranous bone onto which type I collagen-containing Sharpey fibers are often attached. Fibrous dysplasia is also characterized by high expression of c-Fos/c-Jun, known targets for cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling. In this study, we examined the expression of the bone-related extracellular matrix protein, periostin, and its known receptor, integrin alpha v beta 3 (CD51/61), in normal bones as well as in fibrous dysplasia. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies revealed that periostin was expressed in the extracellular matrix during intramembranous but not endochondral ossification, as well as in the fibrous component of fibrous dysplasia; and all cells adjacent to periostin-positive regions expressed CD51/61. Importantly, periostin was abundantly localized to Sharpey fibers. To investigate the contribution of c-Fos, we examined transgenic mice overexpressing c-fos, which develop sclerotic lesions closely resembling those found in fibrous dysplasia. In all lesions, transformed osteoblasts expressed high levels of periostin, whereas normal osteoblasts did not. Our results show that periostin is a novel marker for intramembranous ossification, and is a good candidate as a diagnostic tool and/or a therapeutic target in fibrous dysplasia. Moreover, the Gs alpha-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-c-Fos pathway might represent one mechanism of periostin up-regulation in fibrous dysplasia, resulting in altered collagen fibrillogenesis characteristic of this disease.. Title: Periostin, a novel marker of intramembranous ossification, is expressed in fibrous dysplasia and in c-Fos-overexpressing bone lesions.","target":"yes","rationale":"The title summarizes the main idea of the abstract and provides a short description of its significance.

The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), Graham Gano (2018), and Brett Maher (2019). The record in the CFL is 62 yards, set by Paul McCallum on October 27, 2001. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four-point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In six-man football, where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the number of years that Prater had been playing professional football, which is mentioned in the passage as \\"The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013.\\" No other information or proper nouns are needed to answer the question."},{"source":"Answer the question below:\\n\\n\\nWater that is far from a lot of plants has few nutrients or many nutrients? \\n\\n\\nAssuming that:\\n\\nMost nutrients are washed into ocean water from land.

Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of \\"man's place in the universe\\". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics, which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms. In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project).\\nWhat was the name of the book that Darwin wrote about evolution?","target":"On the Origin of Species","rationale":"The context discusses Darwin's theory of evolution in its current form and the implications it has on different areas.

She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\\n\\nAlright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\\n\\nSo a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\\n\\nA lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\\n\\nSo at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\\n\\nLast Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \\n\\nOf course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \\"not for me\\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\\n\\nI'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her.

Between The Dalles and Portland, the river cuts through the Cascade Range, forming the dramatic Columbia River Gorge. No other rivers except for the Klamath and Pit River completely breaches the Cascades—the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains. The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River are on the Modoc Plateau; downstream the Pit cuts a canyon through the southern reaches of the Cascades. In contrast, the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link. The river continues west, bending sharply to the north-northwest near Portland and Vancouver, Washington, at the Willamette River confluence. Here the river slows considerably, dropping sediment that might otherwise form a river delta. Near Longview, Washington and the Cowlitz River confluence, the river turns west again. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of Astoria, Oregon, over the Columbia Bar, a shifting sandbar that makes the river's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world. Because of the danger and the many shipwrecks near the mouth, it acquired a reputation as the \\"Graveyard of Ships\\".The Columbia drains an area of about 258,000 square miles (670,000 km2).

We chatted for a couple of minutes about life and moved on. The last time we saw each other was a month ago at a mutual friend’s birthday party, and don’t chat over text. I was staying at my boyfriend's that night, where I have a couple of changes of clothes as well as loungewear I usually change into when I’m there. I did exactly that when I got there about an hour after being out and coincidentally seeing this friend, and we stayed in all day.\\n\\nThe next morning I walked home via town since I needed to pick something else up. As ‘luck’ would have it, I saw this friend again (she wasn’t in any uniform and I honestly couldn’t tell you where she works so I don’t know if she was working nearby or something). The crux of this is that I was wearing the same trousers, shirt and jacket as the day before when I’d last seen her. This was because I frankly saw no need to wear another shirt or pair of trousers when I’d literally had them on for around 2 hours in total the day before, and they weren’t stained and didn’t smell. She didn't mention this during our 30 second ‘oh hello again’ chat.\\n\\nThe day goes on, and in the evening I get a message from a friend asking how I was and specifically if I was good for cash. I have a steady job and pay my rent and bills on time, and have never asked friends for money.

I got a reply from her saying that she was here if I needed her, and our friends would rally around me if I was in financial distress - she totally ignored me. I sent a message back being firmer and saying that there was no reason to be concerned, and that I’m a big girl who can handle herself, not that I needed to. I never got a reply back, but my friend who initially told me about it sent me a message about an hour later saying that the girl had only been concerned and I was out of line for slamming her down like I did.\\n\\nIn my biased view, I don’t think I was wrong in this situation.

When Alan pushes his hands together, he reduces both their distance from each other while also contracting the rubber band they're holding onto. Increasing one variable (distance) causes an increase in force but decreasing another variable (contracting of rubber band) would cause a decrease in force overall. So, this means that by pushing his hands together, Alan decreases the strength of the pull on them caused by stretching out or expanding the rubber bands around their wrists\\nSo, answer is decreases"},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

Our friendship had always been really special to me, because he had always been there for me. He supported me through all of my downs, and I tried my best to do the same for him. He was even my wingman when I had a huge crush on one girl in our friend group. (No, that didn't work out but the fact he tried to help still means everything to me) He had always been there for me whenever I was feeling under-confident, upset, or whenever I just felt like I had no one to talk to. I always kind of looked up to him as a better version of myself because I felt like he was better at not letting his emotions control him. Meanwhile, I've always been the sensitive one who tends to get upset over the little things. Hell, I cried once because I saw a dead bird on my way to school. And that was in 9th grade by the way. \\n\\n   I was there for him too because he had problems and struggles of his own. And I feel like us constantly working to help each other, added to the quality of our friendship because we understood each other's issues. We cared about each other more than we cared about ourselves. I felt us growing really close, and I enjoyed every second of it. He yelled at any of our mutual friends whenever they were giving me a hard time.He reminded all of my friends that it was my birthday when all of them had forgotten. And I would do the same for him, but there was one problem. I'm incredibly insecure, my biggest fear is that one day all of my friends might just see me as boring, or annoying, or that they secretly hate me, and that they'll just walk out of my life. I've told him this before too, that I was afraid of being seen as annoying, and that I had abandonment issues. That I sometimes felt jealous or left out, but I also hated myself for feeling that way because I felt like I was ruining everything for everyone by being an attention whore. He said that is was fine, that he didn’t mind it and that he'd always be there. \\n\\n   But, he had a tendency of giving the green stop sign. I'd ask him if he wanted to hang out, play video games, or do whatever and he'd say “yes.” Only to not do whatever we made plans to do. I always dismissed it thinking that sometimes stuff comes up, and that he does have more important things to do. But this kept happening, over and over again. Even on my birthday when we made plans to play video games and he just didn’t go through with it. He said he felt bad and I believed him but, I was just kind of annoyed. We actually hung out more, and then out of the fucking blue he raged at me to leave him alone. After we mutually made plans to hang out??? I ended up leaving and then the longest 2 hours of my life passed before I did the stupidest thing I've ever done. I questioned if he cared about me, and if I was just a burden to him. He immediately apologized and I believe his apology to be genuine but, it just kind of went over my head. I dismissed his apology because at the time, I was just tired of being lied to, having promises broken, and being sent mixed signals. And me being quick to not accept his apology made him angry and then we had a very mundane argument that lasted for a few seconds before he just ended it with “We'll talk later”.  I later came forward and apologized for everything because even now, I blame myself for this whole mess. \\n\\n   I thought we made up for it and I thought that we could just put this behind us. The next day I asked him if we were still cool and he said “yes”. This was 3 days after my birthday and we didn’t really talk much that day, or the next day, or the next day, or the next week, and before I know it. He ghosted me for 3 weeks. And during those 3 weeks some of our mutual friends kind of got us to hang out. But it didn't really work. While I was in my self-loathing state, he was shit talking me to all of our friends. Including once to another one of my friends, right in front of me. Saying things that confirmed all of my deepest insecurities. And I had no one to blame for this but myself. I think it's safe to say he over reacted a bit, but so did I and I still feel like I could have prevented all of this. A lot of our mutual friends stayed passive but some of our friends, after hearing both sides of the story, immediately took my side. And at first it felt nice, but even some of his friends his friends that didn’t know me took my side and that made me feel bad because, literally no one took his side. And I didn’t want him to lose friends over this. We had one mutual friend who took my side and even said he wanted to ghost my friend, but I was the one to talk him out of it. The thing is, now my friend that ghosted me has basically replaced me with my friend who was going to ghost him, as his new best friend. \\n\\n   I'm posting this here because I don't know what to believe. Everyone's been telling me that I'm not at fault, but I still blame myself for it. And lately I guess I've kind of begun to blame my friend more. I often swing back and forth between feeling like it's all my fault, and feeling like my friend was a liar. I still get mixed messages from him like: He said he didn’t say “no” to me because he'd have felt bad about it. But why would he feel bad saying “no” and not feel bad ghosting me. That's why I want to know from you guys because I feel like I'm too emotionally unstable to decide myself.","target":"EVERYBODY","rationale":"The two friends have been growing closer, but the author is insecure and worries that their friend will leave them. While the friend reassures them repeatedly and tries to be supportive, they also tend to cancel plans they make with the author. The author then asks if their friend cares about them, which causes a conflict between the two friends. The conflict escalates until they stop talking for three weeks, during which time they each speak poorly of one another to mutual friends. By this point it seems that both are at fault - while the author's insecurity is understandable given past experiences with abandonment, their actions contributed greatly to worsening an already tense situation by asking if their friend cared about them. Meanwhile, even though it was unkind of the friend to cancel plans repeatedly without good reason or explanation (and especially on an important day such as their birthday) it was inappropriate for them to ghost someone who considers themselves a close friend  - especially in response to what could be considered a rather minor offense on behalf of the other person (directly asking whether or not he cared about him).

The deal was reportedly for £1 million. After signing with Syco, Johnston made public appearances, including performing at Andrew Lloyd Webber's birthday celebrations on 14 September, and at Carlisle United's Brunton Park.Johnston's debut album, One Voice, was released on 29 September 2008. It includes a cover of \\"Walking in the Air\\", performed with Faryl Smith. The album was recorded over a six-week period in London, and the track listing was chosen by Cowell. Johnston described the recording process as \\"brilliant\\", and that it was \\"really good – just to be in a recording studio and meet the different people\\". The album debuted in the British charts at number five, and finished the week at number four. The album was later certified gold, having sold 100,000 copies, and Johnston was presented a gold disc by daytime television presenter Penny Smith. Critics responded positively to the album, with Kate Leaver, writing for the Korea JoongAng Daily, saying Johnston \\"has truer talent than hordes of his musical elders\\" and that \\"the vulnerability\\" of Johnston's performance on the album \\"makes for a haunting musical experience\\". In Music Week, the album was described as \\"highly-anticipated\\", and Johnston was called \\"exceptionally-talented\\".After the album's release, Johnston became involved in the Sing Up campaign, appearing in schools around the country to encourage other young people to join choirs. In December 2008, Johnston made a guest appearance at Whitehaven's Christmas fair, and performed at a carol service in Bradford.

The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted.

Following their 3-1 start to the season, the Bengals had lost all momentum and fallen heavily in the AFC standings.Despite being heavy underdogs, the Bengals came out and grabbed the momentum of the football game early, scoring on their first possession of the game. Playing against a defense that Cincinnati receiver AJ Green remarked \\" a lot of holes,\\" earlier in the week, Green culminated Cincinnati's first possession with a fifty-six yard touchdown reception, beating a badly blown coverage on the play. The score marked Green's eighth straight contest with a touchdown reception, which tied him with former Bengal TJ Houshmandzadeh for second all-time in Bengals history.The ensuing Giants possession was unspectacular, with the Giants going three-and-out and being forced to punt the ball right back to Cincinnati. New York Giant punter Sean Weatherford looked to have gotten a spectacular punt away, which would have forced Cincinnati to start their possession inside their own twenty yard-line. However, a penalty on Giants cornerback Justin Tryon for intentionally leaving the field of play, rendered the punt moot, and forced the Giants to re-attempt the play. On the ensuing punt, Bengals cornerback Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones returned the ball sixty-eight yards to the Giants eleven yard line. The Bengals did not hesitate to take advantage of the large swing in field positioning, as second year quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver Andrew Hawkins for an eleven-yard touchdown strike on third-and-ten. The three play drive took only eighteen second off of the clock, and gave the Bengals a 14-0 advantage. The Giants would see a measure of momentum swing in their favor as following their ensuing possession, which resulted in a three-and-out from New York, Cincinnati receiver Brandon Tate would fumble Sean Weatherford's punt, giving the Giants possession of the football inside Cincinnati territory for the first time on the afternoon. The Giants would somewhat take advantage of the mistake, as they would turn the fumble into a twenty-three yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals would proceed to expand their lead further, putting together a fifteen play drive that took over seven minutes off of the clock and resulted in a twenty-eight yard field goal by Mike Nugent. The conversion put Cincinnati up by a score of 17-3 with time dwindling in the first half. The ensuing Giants possession would take all but eleven second of the 4:17 that remained in the opening half and would see Lawrence Tynes trotted out to convert on a thirty-one yard field goal at its finish. The points got the Giants back to within eleven points at the half, with the score 17-6 in favour of Cincinnati.The first five possessions coming out of the half, two of which ended in New York Giant turnovers, would not result in any points being scored by either team. However, following an Eli Manning interception, Cincinnati would be able to take advantage of the short field and pick up their third touchdown on the afternoon. The Bengals second three-play touchdown drive of the game was capped off by Andy Dalton hitting tight end Jermaine Gresham for a ten-yard receiving touchdown, making the score 24-6 in favour of Cincinnati.New York's next possession would result in Eli Manning firing a second straight interception. The result for Cincinnati would be the same, with Dalton culminating yet another three-play touchdown drive by hitting first-year receiver Mohamed Sanu for a ten-yard strike. The touchdown was Sanu's first receiving touchdown in the National Football League, though he had already thrown for a touchdown in Cincinnati's week 3 encounter with the Washington Redskins. The touchdown, also representing a career-high fourth on the afternoon for Andy Dalton, gave the Bengals their final points of the afternoon, and a 31-6 advantage.The rest of the game was largely uneventful, with both teams accepting the fate of the game as having already been determined. The Giants were able to put up their lone touchdown of the game following a thirteen play, ninety-eight yard possession that was capped by running back Ahmad Bradshaw punching the ball in from two yards away. The lone Giants touchdown of the afternoon would also be the last points put up, making the final score 31-13 Cincinnati. With the victory, the Bengals snapped their previous four game losing streak and improved their record to 4-5 on the season. They also improved to 6-0 all time against the Giants at home.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Passage:At the beginning of the 2013–14 La Liga season, coach Unai Emery named Rakitić as the new Sevilla captain. Since the beginning of the season, he was one of the most prominent players of the league, scoring the first goal and assisting for the second in a 3–2 away loss against Barcelona on 14 September. In the two last games of September, he scored two goals in a 1–4 away win over Rayo Vallecano, and assisted for the draw 1–1 goal against Real Sociedad. In the final three games of October, Rakitić scored a goal in a 2–0 home win against SC Freiburg, a 2–1 home win over Almería and two goals in a 7–3 loss at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium against Real Madrid. In the third and fourth games of November, he contributed an assist in away 1–3 win against Espanyol, and two more respectively in a 4–0 home win against Sevilla rivals Betis. In the last game of December, he assisted in a 1–2 away win against Villarreal, helping Sevilla reach a top ten position after a disappointing start of the season, as well attracting attention from other international clubs.

Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

She lives at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.\\nAnd on Tuesday, August 23rd, witnesses say she seemed to sense the big earthquake that shook much of the East Coast before any humans knew what was going on. And she's not the only one. In the moments before the quake, an orangutan   let out a loud call and then climbed to the top of her shelter.\\n\\"It's very different from their normal call,\\" said Brandie Smith, the zookeeper. \\"The lemurs (monkey-like animals of Madagascar) will sound an alarm call if they see or hear something highly unusual.\\"\\nBut you can't see or hear an earthquake 15 minutes before it happens, can you? Maybe you can -- if you're an animal. \\"Animals can hear above and below our range of hearing,\\" said Brandie Smith. \\"That's part of their special abilities. They're more sensitive to the environment, which is how they survive.\\"\\nPrimates weren't the only animals that seemed to sense the quake before it happened.

Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals.\\n\\n- A gag cartoon (a.k.a. panel cartoon or gag panel) is most often a single-panel cartoon, usually including a caption beneath the drawing. A pantomime cartoon carries no caption. In some cases, dialogue may appear in speech balloons, following the common convention of comic strips.\\n\\n- A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\\n\\n- A cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.\\n\\n- A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging.\\n\\n- A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections.

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence.

The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces.

Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion.

He marked it as case B.\\n\\nIn which case the tree line would be lower, case A or case B?","target":"case A","rationale":"Wind limits tree growth by scouring away thin soils through erosion and damaging limbs and twigs, which may result in the uprooting of trees. On coasts and isolated mountains, wind is a major factor limiting forest height because strong winds reduce tree growth. Winds that are too high can damage or uproot trees even at higher elevations inland. The type of vegetation found on an island also varies with wind exposure: for instance, species growing near coastlines will be pruned back due to salt spray from nearby waves, whereas those further inland might have fewer such limitations on their size (i.e., they would grow taller).\\nSo the answer is case A\\n\\n \\n   * </pre>\\n   */"},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: What is the reason that Cyprus refuses to use the Greek flag?\\nContext: The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece, which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto Eleftheria i thanatos (freedom or death), which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence.

The reason for this change from using the Greek Flag to adopting a neutral one is given as being \\"to ease ethnic tensions\\".\\nEthnic tension refers to conflict between people of different ethnicities or races. In this case, it seems likely that there may be some level of tension between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots because they are ethnically distinct groups (i.e., Greeks vs Turks). As such, we can conclude that avoiding any provocation by not displaying an overtly nationalistic symbol like the Greek Flag would help reduce these tensions.\\nTherefore, our answer should be: Ethnic Tension"},{"source":"See the conversation.

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the 'cydippids' are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.","target":"When did the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction happen?","rationale":"The question is about a specific time mentioned in the passage, so it should be \\"When did the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction happen?\\""},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.

The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said.

In this situation, the fiancé has decided to break off the engagement, which leaves the original poster (OP) in a difficult position. However, kicking someone out of their house is a very extreme reaction to such a circumstance and could be considered unethical on that basis.\\n\\nFor action B, calling somebody insulting names can be incredibly hurtful and harmful. It also is not justified by any particular reason in this case; it appears to be random name-calling of somebody who had done nothing wrong or inappropriate toward OP. This behavior could also reflect poorly on OP's character in general if they were known as a person who insulted others frequently or inappropriately. The effects are more far-reaching than those associated with action A because even though kicking someone out of their home can be very upsetting for them personally (and possibly damaging to their reputation as well), it would not likely have an effect on other people beyond that individual whereas name-calling may cause others to view OP negatively as well or impact them directly if others engage in similar behaviors because they have seen it from OP first hand and believe that it is acceptable based on his/her example.\\n\\nTherefore, action B has greater negative implications for both individuals involved directly and society at large than does action A when considering ethics alone as there are no extenuating circumstances described by the OP which would justify calling somebody hurtful names without provocation whereas there are some valid reasons why kicking one's fiancé out after she breaks up with them might be understandable depending on how close they live near family members/friends who could help support them through the challenging time instead of having to suddenly find somewhere else to live while dealing with heartbreak from an unexpected breakup at once."},{"source":"You are given a concatenated string consisting of two parts that are separated by a newline character.

They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.","target":"None","rationale":"The question asks what forces can be modeled using ideal friction strings.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural.

The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse.

Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade\\n\\nAlydar was made the 6-5 favorite for Kentucky Derby, with Affirmed the second choice at 9-5 and undefeated Sensitive Prince the third choice at 9-2. At the start of the Kentucky Derby, Sensitive Prince took the early lead as Affirmed ran in third through the early stages, while Alydar stayed far back. Affirmed made a strong move for the lead on the far turn, put away a challenge by Wood Memorial winner Believe It, and held off Alydar's fast-closing charge to win by 1 1/2 lengths. Affirmed now had a 5-2 edge in the series.  In the Preakness Stakes, Affirmed set the pace. Alydar made his big move on the far turn, at the same point in the race where Affirmed made his winning move in the Derby. Affirmed held a short lead entering the stretch and held it to defeat Alydar by a neck.  Alydar's partisans assumed that the 1 1/2 mile distance of the Belmont, two furlongs longer than the Derby and 5/16 of a mile longer than the Preakness Stakes, would favor Alydar with his finishing style and staying pedigree, and he would deny Affirmed the Triple Crown. Trainer Veitch removed Alydar's blinkers for the Belmont, saying that if Alydar got a better look at Affirmed, maybe he would get by him.  In the Belmont, Affirmed led and set a very slow pace, going the first quarter mile in 25 seconds and the half in 50 seconds. Alydar's jockey, Jorge Velasquez, put Alydar close to the pace, and moved alongside Affirmed with more than seven furlongs to go. For more than six furlongs (half the distance of the race), the colts raced neck and neck, pulling away from the rest of the field. Alydar got his nose in front at mid-stretch, but just as Affirmed appeared to tire, Cauthen went to a left-handed whip, something he had never done before in his eight rides on Affirmed. Affirmed won by a nose to become racing's 11th (and last winner for 37 years until American Pharoah won in 2015), Triple Crown winner. After the third slowest start in Belmont Stakes history, they raced the fastest last mile in Belmont Stakes history, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5 and finished in 2:26 4/5. It was, at the time, the third fastest Belmont ever, behind Secretariat and Gallant Man.  His Triple Crown win set two records: the shortest and longest gaps between the previous and next Triple Crown winners. Affirmed's win in 1978 was the first time the Triple Crown had been won in consecutive years (Seattle Slew won in 1977). Affirmed's win also marked the start of the longest gap until the next Triple Crown winner, with American Pharoah's win on June 6, 2015 occurring 37 years later.\\n\\nWhen did he win the triple crown?","target":"2015","rationale":"The context mentions that Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah.

Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals.

In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society.

Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. For the team's first defensive play, they would come out with only 10 players on the field, as their honor to Taylor. In the first quarter, the Redskins took the early lead as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got on the board as linebacker Angelo Crowell sacked quarterback Jason Campbell in his end zone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half as Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills drew closer as kicker Rian Lindell managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Later, the Redskins responded with running back Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When the Bills tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved the Bills 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards.

Peele appeared for five seasons as a cast member on Mad TV, and starred with Keegan-Michael Key in the Comedy Central sketch series Key & Peele. In 2014, he had a recurring role in the first season of the FX anthology series Fargo, based on the 1996 film of the same name. Peele's 2017 directorial debut, the horror film Get Out, earned critical acclaim and was a box office success.\\nContext: Peele regularly performed at Boom Chicago in Amsterdam and The Second City in Chicago. He and Nicole Parker were well known for their musical duets at Boom Chicago. He portrayed a popular character called \\"Danish Supermodel Ute\\" during his time at Boom Chicago and hosted MTV's Comedy Weekend in 2002.  In 2003, Peele joined the cast of Mad TV for its ninth season. Around the time Keegan-Michael Key joined the cast as a featured performer, it was assumed that Key would be chosen over Peele. The two of them ultimately were cast together after showing great comedic chemistry. Peele performed celebrity impersonations, which included favorites Caroll Spinney (as the voice of Big Bird from Sesame Street), Ja Rule, James Brown, Flavor Flav, Justin Guarini, Montel Williams, Morgan Freeman and Forest Whitaker. Peele was absent from the first four episodes of his second season on Mad TV. He made a cameo in \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's video \\"White & Nerdy\\" with Mad TV co-star Keegan-Michael Key.  Peele was nominated for a 2008 Emmy Award for his song \\"Sad Fitty Cent\\", a music video parody about 50 Cent lamenting over his rivalry with Kanye West. The lyrics were, according to the music video, written by Peele, and he was involved in arranging its music. In 2009 he appeared in Little Fockers.  Peele appeared in a viral video titled \\"Hillary vs Obama\\" (which was shown as a Mad TV sketch) where he and a Hillary Clinton supporter (played by short-term cast member Lisa Donovan) argue over whether Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama would make a better president, only to get upstaged by a Rudy Giuliani supporter (played by Donovan's brother, Ben). Peele auditioned to be a castmember for Saturday Night Live when SNL producers were looking for someone to play Barack Obama (around the time when SNL and Mad TV -- and other scripted shows -- were put on hiatus due to the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike). Peele remained at Mad TV and the role went to Fred Armisen until September 2012, when Jay Pharoah took over the role.

MDA-MB-157 cells were shown to express the alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme produced by normal breast tissue, and the activity of this isoenzyme increased 3-fold after a 72-h treatment of these cells with 10(-7) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], 2-fold after treatment with 10(-6) M hydrocortisone (HC), and 5-fold after treatment with both hormones. BT20 cells did not express the isoenzyme phenotypic to breast, but ectopically expressed the isoenzyme phenotypic to term placenta and other embryonic tissue. Treatment of BT20 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 results in a 30% decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity of the embryonic isoenzyme. There was a 2-fold increase in activity after treatment with HC, and enzyme activity was similar to control values after treatment with both hormones. For both cell lines, changes in alkaline phosphatase activity correlated with changes in nanograms of isoenzyme per mg cellular protein, as measured by RIA. Increases in enzyme activity were inhibited when the cells were incubated simultaneously with the steroids and cycloheximide. Studies with receptors in each cell line showed that both cell lines bound 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that a 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding protein with the same mol wt as the D3 receptor was present in both. The BT20 cells also express a larger mol wt protein which binds 1,25-(OH)2D3 but is not as specific for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 isomer. HC receptors were similar in quantity and binding affinity in both cell lines.","target":"Alkaline Phosphatase","rationale":"The paper focuses on the regulation of alkaline phosphatase activity by steroid hormones.

Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Cardiac abnormalities in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. option2: Alcoholic liver disease in Japan.","target":"Cardiac abnormalities in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma","rationale":"The abstract describes clinical cardiac abnormalities in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Body weight, pulmonary artery pressure, and morphometric changes of the pulmonary artery with the histopathologic method were observed weekly for 4 weeks. Also, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and inflammatory cytokine expression in the lung were measured.', 'Four weeks after monocrotaline administration, mean pulmonary artery pressure in the MCT+FR group was lower than in the MCT group (MCT+FR vs MCT: 24.7 +/- 1.9 vs 36.5 +/- 2.1 mm Hg; P < .05). In morphometric analysis the percentage of medial wall thickness and the percentage of muscularization in the MCT+FR group were reduced compared with those in the MCT group after 4 weeks (P < .05); however, the number of macrophages was not significantly different. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was significantly attenuated in the MCT+FR group compared with in the MCT group (7.2 +/- 0.52 vs 2.1 +/- 0.23 fold-increase, P < .05, at 1 week). Although mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta were reduced in the MCT+FR group compared with in the MCT group (tumor necrosis factor alpha: 1.18 +/- 0.36 vs 3.05 +/- 1.12 fold-increase, P < .05, at 2 weeks; interleukin 1beta: 2.2 +/- 0.34 vs 4.4 +/- 1.09 fold-increase, P < .05, at 1 week), FR167653 did not suppress increased monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mRNA expression induced by monocrotaline (3.2 +/- 0.62 vs 3.1 +/- 0.42 fold-increase, at 1 week).\\\\Question: Does specific inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase with FR167653 attenuate vascular proliferation in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats?","target":"FR167653 significantly attenuates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, ultimately preventing the progression of pulmonary hypertension.

We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+, and CD14+CD16+) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT. We defined vulnerability of intracoronary plaques according to the presence of positive remodeling (remodeling index >1.05) and/or low CT attenuation (<35 HU). The circulating CD14++CD16+monocytes more frequently expressed TLR-4 than CD14++CD16-and CD14+CD16+monocytes (P<0.001). The relative proportion of the expression of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes was significantly greater in patients with vulnerable plaque compared with those without (10.4 [4.1-14.5] % vs. 4.5 [2.8-7.8] %, P=0.012). In addition, the relative proportion of TLR-4 expression on CD14++CD16+monocytes positively correlated with the remodeling index (r=0.28, P=0.025) and negatively correlated with CT attenuation value (r=-0.31, P=0.013).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Upregulation of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes might be associated with coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with SAP.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that describes the background, motivation, and purpose of the study (\\"BACKGROUND Although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is involved in monocyte activation in patients with accelerated forms of atherosclerosis...\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment.

Again in the 1990s, after joining the European Economic Community, the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) road network, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of system of 44 motorways. Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an innovative project that made Portugal among one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5). But, although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970), it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented. In 1972, Brisa, the highway concessionaire, was founded to handle the management of many of the regions motorways. On many highways, toll needs to be paid, see Via Verde.

Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but experienced an increase early in the 21st century, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively. Ireland's patron saints are Saint Patrick, Saint Bridget and Saint Columba. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations. As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the Fifth Amendment in a referendum. Article 44 remains in the Constitution: \\"The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.\\" The article also establishes freedom of religion, prohibits endowment of any religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

While signiﬁcant progress has been made, the growing complexity of network designs, meta-learning algorithms, and differences in implementation details make a fair comparison difﬁcult. In this paper, we present 1) a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classiﬁcation algorithms, with results showing that deeper backbones signiﬁcantly reduce the gap across methods including the baseline, 2) a slightly modiﬁed baseline method that surprisingly achieves competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art on both the mini-ImageNet and the CUB datasets, and 3) a new experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classiﬁcation algorithms. Our results reveal that reducing intra-class variation is an important factor when the feature backbone is shallow, but not as critical when using deeper backbones. In a realistic, cross-domain evaluation setting, we show that a baseline method with a standard ﬁne-tuning practice compares favorably against other state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms.","target":"A detailed empirical study in few-shot classification that revealing challenges in standard evaluation setting and showing a new direction","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA detailed empirical study in few-shot classification that revealing challenges in standard evaluation setting and showing a new direction."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a dialogue from a conversation between an agent and a customer.

Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- Rangnang - guyk or Rangnang District is one of the 19 kuyk that constitute the city of Pyongyang , North Korea .

In July 2004, they became the first UNESCO World Heritage site in the country. The site consists of 30 individual tombs from the later Goguryeo kingdom, one of Three Kingdoms of Korea, located in the cities of P'yngyang and Namp'o. Goguryeo was one of the strongest Korean kingdoms in the north east of China and the Korean Peninsula from 37 BCE to the 7th century CE. The kingdom was founded in the present day area of Northern Korea, and part of Manchuria around 37 BCE, and the capital was transferred to P'yngyang in 427 CE.\\n\\n- The Taedong River (Chosn'gl: ) is a large river in North Korea. It rises in the Rangrim Mountains of the country's north. It then flows southwest into Korea Bay at Namp'o. In between, it runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang.

Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.\\n\\nA frequent critic of the U.S. tax system, Kovacs owed the Internal Revenue Service several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes, due to his simple refusal to pay the bulk of them. Up to 90% of his earnings were garnished as a result. His long battles with the IRS inspired Kovacs to invest his money in a convoluted series of paper corporations in the U.S. and Canada. He would give them bizarre names, such as \\"The Bazooka Dooka Hicka Hocka Hookah Company\\". In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes; that same day he bought the California Racquet Club with the apparent hope of being able to use it as a tax write-off. The property had mortgages at the time of purchase which were later paid by Edie Adams.  His tax woes also affected Kovacs's career, forcing him to take any offered work to pay his debt. This included the ABC game show Take A Good Look, appearances on variety shows such as NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, and some of his less memorable movie roles. He also filmed an unaired 1962 pilot episode for a proposed CBS series, Medicine Man (co-starring Buster Keaton, pilot episode titled \\"A Pony For Chris\\"). Kovacs's role was that of Dr. P. Crookshank, a traveling medicine salesman in the 1870s selling Mother McGreevy's Wizard Juice, also known as \\"man's best friend in a bottle\\". This was abandoned after his death, which occurred the day after filming some scenes for the pilot in Griffith Park. CBS initially intended to broadcast the show as part of a summer replacement program, The Comedy Spot, but decided against it due to problems with Kovacs's estate. The pilot is part of the public collection of the Paley Center for Media.  Some of the issues regarding Kovacs's tax problems were still unresolved years after his death. Kovacs had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961. To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. The court's early 1966 ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: \\"Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done Mary Kovacs.\\"  Adams, who married and divorced twice after Kovacs's death, refused help from celebrity friends who planned a benefit for the purpose. Saying \\"I can take care of my own children\\", and being determined to accept offers only from those who wanted to hire her for her talents, Adams managed to pay all of Kovacs' debts.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what did he do to pay his debt off?","target":"take any offered work to pay his debt.","rationale":"The passage states that Kovacs's tax woes affected his career, forcing him to take any offered work to pay his debt.

Recently, the G-308A polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene has been associated with modified gene expression and increased TNF-alpha production in the -308A allele. We evaluated its influence on the incidence and clinical course of membranous glomerulonephritis.', 'We studied 53 patients with biopsy-proven primary membranous glomerulonephritis followed up for 5.7 +/- 4.9 years. 100 volunteers were analyzed as controls. According to the slope of the curve of reciprocal serum creatinine against time, group A (slow progressors, n = 35) and group B (fast progressors, n = 18) were defined. TNF-alpha G-308A polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification.', 'The frequency of the A-allele (associated with higher TNF-alpha levels) was significantly higher in patients than control subjects (patients: G-allele: 0.66, A-allele: 0.34; controls: G-allele 0.85, A-allele 0.15, p < 0.001).

The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.Meanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph's army at Solferino in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach.

The park, nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, is in the Loyalsock Creek valley on Pennsylvania Route 154, in Forks and Shrewsbury Townships southeast of the borough of Forksville. The name Worlds End has been used since at least 1872, but its origins are uncertain. Although it was founded as Worlds End State Forest Park by Governor Gifford Pinchot in 1932, the park was officially known as Whirls End State Forest Park from 1936 to 1943.The park's land was once home to Native Americans, followed by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially a result of the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\\nA wide variety of wildlife is found in the park, which is also part of an Important Bird Area. Located in the Endless Mountains region of the dissected Allegheny Plateau, Worlds End has a continental climate and rocks and fossils from the Carboniferous period. It is one of \\"Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" named by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, which describes it as \\"[v]irtually in a class by itself, this wild, rugged and rustic area seems almost untamed\\". The park offers year-round recreational opportunities, including environmental education, hiking, camping in tents and cabins, whitewater rafting, swimming, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, hunting, and fishing.","target":"Worlds End State Park","rationale":"The context of the article is about Worlds End State Park in Pennsylvania.

Before they retire, they wanted to release a bonus track album from leftovers from seventies and eighties just for the fans. After playing the final show in Munich in December, 2012, band planned to take a break and go on vacation. In January, 2013, MTV contacted the band and asked if they are interested in doing the MTV Unplugged album. They agreed on doing that project and turned out to be successful. That whole thing pushed back the bonus track project. As soon as they have finished the MTV Unplugged project, band immediately went back to studio to work on bonus track project. Band was listening the recordings they have already prepared for the project. They were happy with the result and Rudolf Schenker said that he has a tape with some songs that they could also use for this project. While searching for the tape, Schenker found an old ledger in which his mother enumerated the loans that his father provided to him, so he could buy all the equipment and establish the band. He looked into the book and it said: \\"September, 1965\\". He went back to the studio and told the band what he found and their manager said that it would be great idea to celebrate 50th Anniversary since they are the only German band who is 50 years in music and one of the few in the world along with The Rolling Stones, The Who, Beach Boys and Pink Floyd. Manager suggested to the band that they contact the promoters and see if they are interested in band doing the 50th Anniversary Tour. Then Schenker suggested that if band is going to do a 50th Anniversary Tour, then band needs to release brand new studio album. So the band went again into the listening process of bonus track material that they have already prepare and see if they can improve something, like choruses and riffs.

Perhaps the painters thought that their pictures would help them to catch these animals. Or perhaps human beings have always wanted to tell stories according to pictures.\\nAbout 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians and other people in the Near East began to use pictures as kind of writing. They drew simple pictures or signs to represent things and ideas, and also to represent the sounds of their language. The signs these people used became a kind of alphabet.\\nThe Egyptians used to record information and to tell stories by putting picture writing and pictures together. When an important person died, scenes and stories from his life were painted and carved on the walls of the place where he was buried. Some of these pictures are like modern comic strip stories. It has been said that Egypt is the home of the comic strip. But, for the Egyptians, pictures still had magic power. So they did not try to make their way of writing simple. The ordinary people could not understand it.\\nBy the year 1,000 BC, people who lived in the area around the Mediterranean Sea had developed a simpler system of writing. The signs they used were very easy to write, and there were fewer of them than in the Egyptian system. This was because each sign, or letter, represented only one sound in their language. The Greeks developed this system and formed the letters of the Greek alphabet. The Romans copied the idea, and the Roman alphabet is now used all over the world.\\nThese days, we can write down a story, or record information, without using pictures. But we still need pictures of all kinds: drawing, photographs, signs and diagrams. We find them everywhere: in books and newspapers, in the street, and on the walls of the places...\\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is TRUE?\\nOptions: A: The Egyptian signs later became a particular alphabet.\\nB: The Egyptians liked to write comic strip stories.\\nC: The Roman alphabet was developed from the Egyptian one.\\nD: The Greeks copied their writing system from the Egyptians.","target":"A","rationale":"The article explains that the people living in the area around the Mediterranean Sea developed a simpler system of writing after they had used pictures to represent things and ideas.

Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life, Dick. Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married, thus bringing us closer to our dream.

The kits allow customers to purchase vaping components separately so they can make their own products, officials said. The option was announced by Freedom Vapes owners Ron and Deanna Marshall a day after the start of a four-month statewide ban on all flavored vaping products. Freedom Vapes was one of the businesses that unsuccessfully sued Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and his administration to stop the ban. The Marshalls have not returned calls for comment since the ban was put in place on Wednesday, but a statement on their shops’ Facebook page Thursday said they plan to offer the kits for the duration of the 120-day ban. “We are trying our best to keep your needs met while we work through this blatant witchhunt (sic) against our business, and products that have helped all of you break the deadly habit of tobacco use,” the statement said. Their Facebook announcement also warns customers that buying cheap ingredients off the shelf could lead to serious lung damage or death, they said. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services spokesman Jon Ebelt said Friday it’s not yet clear whether the kits are in compliance with the ban. “If retailers are offering flavor components intended for use in e-cigarettes, including in the do-it-yourself kits, it would fall under the temporary restriction,” Ebelt said in an email. “The flavor may be subject to enforcement.” Do-it-yourself products may lack quality controls and health officials recommend consumers refrain from using any e-cigarettes at this time, he added.

The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase.","target":"Free radical reduction by thioredoxin reductase at the surface of normal and vitiliginous human keratinocytes","rationale":"The title should reflect the focus of the paper. In summary, the paper describes an enzyme activity that exists on the surface of human keratinocytes and is capable of reducing free radicals. This property is present in both normal and vitiliginous skin cells, and is observed to be higher in adult than neonatal cells. Also, it is regulated by calcium concentrations in cell culture medium. Based on these findings, my suggestion would be: \\"Free radical reduction by thioredoxin reductase at the surface of normal and vitiliginous human keratinocytes\\"."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nAn isomer with less branching than another will have a higher or lower melting point? \\n\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nThe more branching there is in isomers, the lower the boiling and melting points are.","target":"higher","rationale":"The paragraph states that the more branching there is in isomers, the lower the boiling and melting points.

Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations.
