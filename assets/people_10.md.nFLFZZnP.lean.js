In a career spanning more than forty years, he has been a member of five successful rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, Eagles, the Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup the Best. Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings.\\nContext: Walsh is active in charity work and has performed in a number of concerts to raise money for charitable causes. He has also been a personal contributor to a number of charity causes including halfway houses for displaced adult women in Wichita, Kansas. Walsh funded the first talent-based scholarship at Kent State University in 2008.  Walsh's love of Santa Cruz Island grew into a lifelong commitment to conserve the environment there, and he has been active in preserving the island's parks. He is President of the Santa Cruz Island Foundation, and has served on the Foundation's board since the 1980s.  Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992. Walsh ran for President of the United States in 1980, promising to make \\"Life's Been Good\\" the new national anthem if he won, and ran on a platform of \\"Free Gas For Everyone\\". Though Walsh was only 32 at the time of the election and thus would not have met the 35-year-old requirement to actually assume office, he said that he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. In 1992 Walsh ran for vice president with Rev. Goat Carson under the slogan \\"We Want Our Money Back!\\"  In an interview to promote his album Analog Man in 2012, Walsh revealed he was considering a serious bid for political office. \\"I think I would run seriously, and I think I would run for Congress,\\" Walsh told WASH in Washington, D.C. \\"The root of the problem is that Congress is so dysfunctional. We're dead in the water until Congress gets to work and passes some new legislation to change things.\\"  In 2017, Walsh contacted others in the music industry Zac Brown Band, Gary Clark Jr., Keith Urban to try to organize and perform what became VetsAid  - a concert series along the lines of the Farm Aid program spearheaded by country entertainer Willie Nelson.\\nQuestion: What part of the country does he donate to?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Wichita, Kansas.","rationale":"The context states that Walsh is active in charity work and has performed a number of concerts to raise money for charitable causes. \\nSpecifically, the text mentions his donation towards halfway houses for displaced adult women in Wichita, Kansas.

The Redskins started the game very well with Josh Wilson recovering a Danny Amendola fumble and returning it to the endzone for a 7-0 Redskins lead on the first snap of the game. St. Louis would fight back, however, and pick up a Greg Zuerlein 39-yard field goal to cut the Redskins advantage to 7-3. Washington would close the first quarter with a Robert Griffin III touchdown run to give the Redskins a 14-3 lead going into the second quarter. In the second, St. Louis continued to battle, as Zuerlein hit another field goal. However, on the Redskins' ensuing possession, Griffin III connected with Leonard Hankerson for a 68-yard strike on a play action pass, and the Redskins appeared to take firm control, with a 21-6 edge. However, St. Louis would prove resilient, led by Danny Amendola's 12 receptions in the first half, St. Louis pulled within 8 when Sam Bradford found the aforementioned Amendola to cut the Redskins' advantage to 21-13. Then, just before the half, Griffin threw his first career interception to Cortland Finnegan which set up Zuerlein's 42-yard field goal as the half ended to cut the lead to 21-16. In the third, momentum continued to swing St. Louis' way as Bradford found a wide open Brandon Gibson to give St. Louis its first advantage of the game. Griffin III continued to amaze as he found the endzone for a second time on the ground, and Washington ended the third quarter up 28-23. However, late in the third, for the second straight week, a Saverio Rocca punt was blocked, this time by St. Louis tight end Matthew Mulligan. To open the fourth, Bradford found Mulligan, and rookie Daryl Richardson scampered into the endzone for the two-point conversion, and St. Louis led 31-28. Washington was unable to get into position to tie the game, but had an opportunity late when Richardson fumbled and DeJon Gomes picked it up to give Washington the ball with less than three minutes to play. Washington drove the ball to the St. Louis 29, which would have set up a 46-yard field goal attempt by Billy Cundiff, but Josh Morgan was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after he threw the ball at Cortland Finnegan, moving Washington back to the St. Louis 46, and making it a 62-yard field goal. Cundiff's attempt was wide right and well short of the distance, and St. Louis held on for the 31-28 win. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 1-1.

In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\".

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military...\\nWhat did Tun Perak do?

After he had gone over budget to record a follow-up album, Island did not release it nor pick up their option on him, and in 1983, he left the Bernstein Agency. He chose Denardo Coleman to manage his career while overcoming his reticence of public performance, which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly White music industry. According to Nicholson, \\"the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection\\" during the 1980s. Coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with Prime Time.In a 1986 article for The New York Times on Coleman's work with Prime Time, Robert Palmer said Of Human Feelings was still innovative and radical by the standards of other music in 1982, three years after it was recorded. Because writers and musicians had heard its test pressing in 1979, the album's mix of jazz improvisation and gritty, punk and funk-derived energy sounded \\"prophetic\\" when it was released, Palmer explained. \\"The album is clearly the progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock, black dance rhythms, and free jazz.\\" AllMusic critic Scott Yanow said although Coleman's compositions never achieved popularity, they succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style, which was high-brow yet catchy.

This study followed the treatment progress of 20 patients for a mean of 39 months after intake. The study included a detailed history, neurological examination, and psychological testing on each patient. At follow-up each patient was interviewed and a questionnaire was completed by his or her therapist to assess treatment response. Although nine patients achieved partial or full integration, complete integration was maintained by only five. During therapy the unintegrated patients experienced emotional trauma at approximately twice the rate as did the patients who eventually became integrated. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and hypnosis were the most widely prescribed therapies. The improvement in multiple personality appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion from acceptance of the diagnosis to integration. The progress of therapy was hindered most commonly by the overuse of the mental mechanisms of repression and denial, the continued utilization of secrecy, which began during child abuse, and the production of numerous crises. The most common countertransferences included anger, exasperation, and emotional exhaustion. Although the psychotherapy of patients with multiple personality is tedious and time consuming, it can be eminently successful if the patient and therapist persevere.","target":"Treatment progress in 20 patients with multiple personality disorder","rationale":"The paper describes the treatment progress in 20 patients with multiple personality disorder.

In females, FSH promotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.

The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.\\n\\n- Early life.\\nMiura was born on October 3, 1949, in Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan, the son of a ship's engineer. He has one younger brother and one younger sister. Miura began training in Shotokan karate at the age of 13 years, and had been promoted to the rank of 2nd \\"dan\\" black belt by his 18th birthday. He also studied judo in his youth, achieving the rank of 1st \\"dan\\" in that art by the time he was 17. In 1967, aged 18, he began studying Kyokushin karate in a club at Josai International University. His teacher was Yoshiji Soeno at the university. Miura also studied this karate in summer vacation at the \\"honbu dojo\\" (headquarters training hall) of the Kyokushin in Tokyo.\\n\\n- Combat or fight is a purposeful violent conflict meant to weaken, establish dominance over, or kill the opposition, or to drive the opposition away from a location where it is not wanted or needed.\\n\\n- Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899  29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, at times referred to as \\"The Master of Suspense\\". He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres. He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England's best director. Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955.\\n\\n- Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.\\n\\n- Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is promoted by UNESCO as a counterpart to the World Heritage focusing mainly on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.\\n\\n- A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.\\n\\n- Works.\\nManga.\\nAll listings are as Ikki Kajiwara unless otherwise specified.\\n\\n- Karate Bearfighter (   Kenka karate kyokushin burai ken , literally \`\` Fighting Karate - Brutal Ultimate Truth Fist '' ) is a Japanese martial arts film made by Toei Company in 1975 and directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi . It is the second installment of a trilogy of films based on the manga Karate Baka Ichidai ( literal title : \`\` A Karate - Crazy Life '' ) by Ikki Kajiwara , Jiro Tsunoda and Jya Kagemaru . Sonny Chiba reprises his role from Champion of Death as Masutatsu Oyama , the historical founder of Kyokushin karate in Japan ( Oyama makes a cameo appearance in the film as well ) . Chiba was an interesting choice for the role , as he had studied martial arts under the real - life Oyama for several years . True to the film 's title , at one point in the course of the narrative he battles a \`\` bear '' , actually a human actor in a bear costume .\\n\\n- , also known as Sonny Chiba, is a Japanese actor, singer, film producer, film director, and martial artist.\\n\\n- A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.\\n\\n- A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- History.\\nFounding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan.\\nAfter formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, \\"The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" were held in Tokyo. World Championships have been held at four-yearly intervals since.\\n\\n- Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.\\n\\n- Martial arts film is a film genre. A subgenre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as hand-to-hand combats, stuntwork, chases, and gunfights.\\n\\n- Performing arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices and/or their bodies, often in relation to other objects, to convey artistic expression. It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint/canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include several disciplines but every one is performed in front of live audiences.\\n\\n- A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. \\n\\n- Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Almost at once, we notice his appearance, style of dress, and manner of speech. Furthermore (besides), as we listen to what he has to say and observe the things he does, we begin to form some ideas of what kind of person he is and what he intends to do. As you know from your own experience, though, we do not only gather these separate pieces of information. Instead, we go further and combine them into a unified   picture. In short, we form an overall impression of each person we meet--an impression that can be favorable (making people like) or unfavorable. But how precisely (exactly) do we perform this task?

Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.\\nDespite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric.

The group was founded by Suffa (Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, Back\\n\\nOn 22 September 2003, Hilltop Hoods released their third album, The Calling, which became a commercial breakthrough. In an interview after the release of their fourth album, Suffa revealed that The Calling was recorded on his mother's computer and the simplicity of their 'studio' is the reason why some of the music on the album is in monaural ('mono') sound.  The Calling entered the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004 and reached No. 53 before exiting the top 100 in September of the same year. By December 2006 it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units, becoming the first Australian hip hop album to achieve platinum status. In March 2012, it re-entered the chart and peaked at No. 50 - eight-and-a-half years after its first release. It featured two singles, \\"The Nosebleed Section\\" and \\"Dumb Enough\\", which were listed in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003. \\"The Nosebleed Section\\" was ranked No. 17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. Hilltop Hoods' chart and commercial success was a turning point in the Australian Hip Hop scene because it demonstrated widespread support for the genre that reached beyond an underground fan base.  On 1 April 2006, the group followed with their fourth album, The Hard Road, which peaked at number one. It was the first Australian hip hop album to do so. It was certified gold within a week of being released. Its lead single, \\"Clown Prince\\", reached the top 30 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. It featured guest verses from New York rapper, Omni, and British MCs, Mystro and Braintax. The Hilltop Hoods received the inaugural Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Independent Artist of the Year and Best Performing Independent Album for The Hard Road in 2006. The track, \\"The Blue Blooded\\", is a collaboration with Australian MCs: Funkoars, Hau from Koolism, Mortar, Vents, Drapht, Muph & Plutonic, Pegz and Robby Balboa. On 27 April of the same year, Hilltop Hoods performed at the Bass in the Grass music festival in Darwin alongside fellow hip hop group, The Herd. That same day they issued a second single, the title track from the album. Its video includes fellow members from the Certified Wise Crew - Cross Bred Mongrels, Terrafirma and Funkoars.  Following the success of The Hard Road Tour in early 2006, the Hilltop Hoods began their second national tour for the year, The Stopping All Stations Tour, which visited more regional areas of Australia as well as the capital cities. They were supported by Koolism and Mystro. Late that year, Hilltop Hoods released their third single from the album, \\"What a Great Night\\". The video shows the group at a club with camera shots panning up and down to reveal a new location. It used special effects and is one of the most expensive video clips for an Australian hip hop group, mirroring the group's rise in success and popularity. Also late in the year the band won the J Award for best album of the year from Triple J. They performed the Homebake Festival and Falls Festival before the end of the year.

This ER was in the same hospital we always went to. As we completed the history etc. I noted “stroke effecting speech.” They had a complete synopsis of dad’s history which I gave them as we checked in. Dad is getting tired and his speech was getting more slurred. My Dad was in work clothes. I was in something pretty casual and my sister was in the same clothes (business attire) that she had put on at 6 a.m. I am sure we looked pretty ragged. In waltzes Dr. Hotshot. He looks around and asks my sister and I who we are. My sister introduced us making sure to introduce me as “Dr. Lea (I think that was the first, last, and only time she called me ‘Dr.”). He then turns to my dad and asked what happened. Knowing how difficult it is to understand Dad, I start to answer. My bad. The doctor abruptly stops me and says, “I didn’t ask you. I want him to tell me.” In hindsight, I realize he wanted to hear dad’s speech as a part of his assessment. Dad begins. His speech is slow and very very slurred. Dr. Hotshot looks totally befuddled. Dad had gotten out about 3 sentences out when Dr. Hotshot stops him and abruptly asks, “Does he always talk like that?” My sister, without missing a beat, replies, “No, sometimes he speaks French.” As I am trying to not swallow my head to keep from laughing, I notice the nurse in the room has buried her mouth in her shoulder.

On the third play of the game, cornerback Eric Davis (American football) returned an interception from Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman for a touchdown. Wide receiver Michael Irvin lost a fumble on Dallas next drive, setting up Youngs 29-yard touchdown pass to Watters.

During four expeditions to Central Asia, he made the Transhimalaya known in the West and located sources of the Brahmaputra, Indus and Sutlej Rivers. He also mapped lake Lop Nur, and the remains of cities, grave sites and the Great Wall of China in the deserts of the Tarim Basin. In his book Fran pol till pol (From Pole to Pole), Hedin describes a journey through Asia and Europe between the late 1880s and the early 1900s.\\n\\nHedin's conservative and pro-German views eventually translated into sympathy for the Third Reich, and this would draw him into increasing controversy towards the end of his life. Adolf Hitler had been an early admirer of Hedin, who was in turn impressed with Hitler's nationalism. He saw the German leader's rise to power as a revival of German fortunes, and welcomed its challenge against Soviet Communism. He was not an entirely uncritical supporter of the Nazis, however. His own views were shaped by traditionalist, Christian and conservative values, while National Socialism was in part a modern revolutionary-populist movement. Hedin objected to some aspects of National Socialist rule, and occasionally attempted to convince the German government to relent in its anti-religious and anti-Semitic campaigns.  Hedin met Adolf Hitler and other leading National Socialists repeatedly and was in regular correspondence with them. The politely-worded correspondence usually concerned scheduling matters, birthday congratulations, Hedin's planned or completed publications, and requests by Hedin for pardons for people condemned to death, and for mercy, release and permission to leave the country for people interned in prisons or concentration camps. In correspondence with Joseph Goebbels and Hans Drager, Hedin was able to achieve the printing of the Daily Watchwords year after year.  The Nazis attempted to achieve a close connection to Hedin by bestowing awards upon him. They asked him to present an address on Sport as a Teacher at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin's Olympic stadium. They made him an honorary member of the German-Swedish Union Berlin (German: Deutsch-Schwedischen Vereinigung Berlin e.V.) In 1938, they presented him with the City of Berlin's Badge of Honor (German: Ehrenplakette der Stadt Berlin). For his 75th birthday on 19 February 1940 they awarded him the Order of the German Eagle; shortly before that date it had been presented to Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh. On New Year's Day 1943 they released the Oslo professor of philology and university rector Didrik Arup Seip from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Hedin's request in order to obtain Hedin's agreement to accept additional honors during the 470th anniversary of Munich University. On 15 January 1943, he received the Gold Medal of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (Goldmedaille der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften). On 16 January 1943 he received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of natural sciences of Munich University. On the same day, the Nazis founded in his absence the Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian Research located at Mittersill Castle, which was supposed to serve the long-term advancement of the scientific legacy of Hedin and Wilhelm Filchner as Asian experts. However, it was instead misused by Heinrich Himmler as an institute of the Research Association for German Genealogical Inheritance (Forschungsgemeinschaft Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V.). On 21 January 1943, he was requested to sign the Golden Book of the city of Munich.  Hedin supported the Nazis in his journalistic activities. After the collapse of Nazi Germany, he did not regret his collaboration with the Nazis because this cooperation had made it possible to rescue numerous Nazi victims from execution, or death in extermination camps.

Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has \\"the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\\".\\n\\nVoldemort does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Emmeline Vance.  Rowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the pensieve as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died, just hours after giving birth. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a psychopath who takes sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \\"Muggles\\", his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world.  In the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered.

After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes.

These programs are well conserved in all organisms and expand our view of evolution. They mediate genome instability, create diversity in antibody formation, expand metabolism and increase fitness of pathogens within host environments. Error-prone DNA replication and repair are genetic variability-causing agents that get stimulated by the onset of cellular stresses. Embedded in these programs is the ability to limit mutagenesis to defined genomic regions and times, ensuring integrity of most of the genome. Recent evidence suggests that factors involved in RNA polymerase (RNAP) processivity or transcriptional derepression contribute to the generation of stress-induced mutations. In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling repair factor, which suggests a novel mechanism from those described in other model systems. \\n Question: In which phase of cell cycle does stress-induced transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) occur?","target":"stationary-phase","rationale":"The relevant text span is \\"stationary-phase mutagenesis\\", which indicates the phase of cell cycle."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question, and your task is to predict the context of the question.

There he laid out a large symmetrical French garden. Charles Eugene filled in the terraces in 1749 to replace them with a large broderie. He then reorganized and expanded the south garden over the next decade. Frederick I again reorganized the south garden in 1797 in a Neoclassical style and Mediterranean theme. He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden's center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with hillocks in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi. Frederick also expanded the garden east to form an English landscape garden (Lower east) and demolished Charles Eugene's opera house to form a medieval-themed landscape garden (Upper east). Two additional gardens, for Frederick and Charlotte, were laid out adjacent to their palace suites. Also in the fantasy garden is the Emichsburg, a folly built from 1798 to 1802 and named after the fabled ancestor of the House of Württemberg, a knight of the House of Hohenstaufen. William I abandoned Ludwigsburg for Rosenstein Palace in Stuttgart and opened the south garden to the public in 1828. The canal was filled in and an orchard planted on the southern lawns, later used to grow potatoes.\\nIn 1947, Albert Schöchle, Director of the State Parks and Gardens Authority, was charged with maintaining the gardens.

Arriving at the store, he finds that the locks to the security shutters are jammed closed with chewing gum, so he hangs a sheet over them with a message written in shoe polish: \\"I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN.\\"\\nDante's day is spent in the purgatory of serving a succession of customers while repeating the fact that he is \\"not even supposed to be here today\\". Stressed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his best friend, Randal Graves. Randal is an irresponsible slacker who works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends most of the entire day at the Quick Stop. They converse about many things to pass time, such as whether or not the contractors working on the second Death Star when it was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi were innocent victims. Other events of the day include the discovery that Dante's high school girlfriend, Caitlin Bree, whom he has been having early morning phone conversations with, is engaged to be married. Dante's current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, also stops in to bring him homemade lasagne. The two talk about Dante's stuck-in-a-rut lifestyle with no motivation to change before having an argument about her past sexual partners.\\nLearning that he is stuck working the store all day, as his boss went to Vermont, Dante convinces his friends to play hockey on the store roof, though the game is short; twelve minutes in, an enraged customer shoots their only ball off the roof and into a sewer. Reopening the store, Dante finds another of his ex-girlfriends has died and her wake is today. Randal talks him into closing the store again and going to the wake. The visit is catastrophic, with Randal and Dante running out to escape in their car. What happened in the wake is not shown, but a subsequent conversation between the two reveals that Randal accidentally knocked over the casket by leaning on it.\\nThat night, Caitlin surprises Dante with a visit. After she assures Dante that the engagement announcement was premature and arranged by her mother, the two trade banter and Dante becomes torn between her and Veronica. He finally decides to take Caitlin on a date and goes home to change. He returns to discover that Caitlin had sex with a dead man in the unlit bathroom, having mistaken the man for Dante (the man had earlier entered the bathroom with a pornographic magazine and had suffered a fatal heart attack while masturbating). An ambulance takes a catatonic Caitlin away along with the man's body.\\nJay and Silent Bob, a pair of slackers who have spent all day loitering (and dealing marijuana) outside RST Video, enter the Quick Stop to shoplift. Dante turns down Jay's offer to party with them. Aware of Dante's problem, Silent Bob pauses before following Jay outside and offers the following wisdom: \\"You know, there's a million fine-looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.\\" Dante then realizes that he loves Veronica. When she returns to the Quick Stop, however, Randal complicates things by revealing that Dante asked Caitlin out. Veronica angrily breaks up with Dante, telling him that Randal informed her of the planned date with Caitlin.\\nWhen Randal enters the Quick Stop after closing RST, Dante attacks him and the two fight. Afterwards, they lie on the floor exhausted. Dante claims that Randal does nothing for him but make his life miserable by getting him fined, offending his customers, and ruining his relationship. For the first time, Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame: Dante, not Randal, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again to go to the wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and \\"overcompensates for having a monkey's job\\". He claims Dante thinks he is more advanced than the customers and storms off with \\"if we're so fucking advanced, what are we doing working here?\\" leaving Dante speechless on the floor.\\nThey reconcile and Dante says he will try to talk to Veronica, visit Caitlin, and possibly get some direction in his life.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"Norlon","rationale":"Due to the greenhouse effect caused by anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, global warming is occurring and will continue to occur.

I was blind by her schedule, so I structured my tasks around her, so I could spend time with her hanging out, going out, going for walks n talks etc. In some cases, she did bring up her grandfather, and every time I'd listen and talk about it. However I never sugar coated it. I tried to voice my stress. Telling her directly, about rejections or how stressed out I am. But at this point she seemed go be already annoyed at me for reasons I couldn't understand, she would often play mobile games and not communicate properly with me, which was not like her.\\n\\nIt was 2-3 months after her arrival when she broke up with me before xmas holidays, stating the reasons being me and my family. For hurting her feelings, and not supporting her at all. She said that she would sit in my bathroom and cry in secret and go to a friends house to sleepover there instead. She also stated very petty reasons that I'm a bad boyfriend, in most cases a lie or an exageration. Her crying state made me fall for it and sympathise with her. She also revealed to me \\"dark secrets\\" that she has never told me about. She said she was suicidal since 12 years old and that before me she cheated horribly with her ex, threatening me that she would do the same to me if we went on for longer, she never spoke to me about any of these things, not even hinting.\\n\\nA lot of her issues, seem to stem from a time before I've known her.

Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.\\n\\nand a hint : Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers?","target":"Tom's","rationale":"This question is about the process of podzolization.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire.

The Eastern plot had very healthy plants and good soil. The Western plot was problematic, the plants were attacked by parasitic fungi.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich plot had fewer fungi disable the sexual reproduction of the plants?\\n\\nHint: Fungi not only evolve to avoid the defenses of the plants, but they also attempt to prevent the plant from enacting the mechanisms to improve its defenses. Anything the fungi can do to slow the evolution process of the host plants will improve the fitness of future generations because the plant will not be able to keep up with the evolutionary changes of the parasite. One of the main processes by which plants quickly evolve in response to the environment is sexual reproduction. Without sexual reproduction, advantageous traits could not be spread through the plant population as quickly allowing the fungi to gain a competitive advantage. For this reason, the sexual reproductive organs of plants are targets for attacks by fungi. Studies have shown that many different current types of obligate parasitic plant fungi have developed mechanisms to disable or otherwise affect the sexual reproduction of the plants. If successful, the sexual reproduction process slows for the plant, thus slowing down evolutionary change or in extreme cases, the fungi can render the plant sterile creating an advantage for the pathogens. It is unknown exactly how this adaptive trait developed in fungi, but it is clear that the relationship to the plant forced the development of the process.Some researchers are also studying how a range of factors affect the rate of evolutionary change and the outcomes of change in different environments. For example, as with most evolution, increases in heritability in a population allow for a greater evolutionary response in the presence of selective pressure. For traits specific to the plant-fungi coevolution, researchers have studied how the virulence of the invading pathogen affects the coevolution. Studies involving Mycosphaerella graminicola have consistently showed that virulence of a pathogen does not have a significant impact on the evolutionary track of the host plant.There can be other factors in that can affect the process of coevolution. For example, in small populations, selection is a...","target":"Eastern","rationale":"The Eastern plot has healthy plants and good soil, so there's no problem with the plant growing process. However, since parasitic fungi can harm the sexual reproduction of a plant by slowing down evolutionary change or rendering it sterile in extreme cases an advantage for pathogens over time is created.\\nTherefore, given that fungus attacks the Western plot which has problematic plants but not on the other hand where we have very healthy plants (Eastern), then fewer fungal attack \\"fewer evolved\\" happens at this side.\\n\\n \\n</details>"},{"source":"Given an entity as input, output another entity which is part of the input entity.

The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with.

New Orleans would initially trail in the first quarter as Falcons running back Michael Turner got a 13-yard touchdown run, yet the Saints answered with running back Pierre Thomas getting a 22-yard touchdown run. Atlanta would come right back as quarterback Drew Brees was sacked by free safety Thomas DeCoud, causing him to fumble and allow defensive end Kroy Biermann to return the ball 4 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, New Orleans would go on a rampage with Brees' 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston, running back Reggie Bush's 1-yard touchdown run, and cornerback Jabari Greer's 48-yard interception return for a touchdown. However, the Falcons began to get back into the game with quarterback Matt Ryan finding wide receiver Roddy White on a 68-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by kicker Jason Elam booting a 25-yard field goal. Fortunately, cornerback Tracy Porter's key interception (helped from linebacker Jonathan Vilma's tip) lead to Brees finding Thomas on a 1-yard touchdown pass. Even though Atlanta crept closer with Elam nailing a 40-yard field goal and recovering an onside kick, free safety Darren Sharper's interception sealed the tight victory.

Although some label structure can implicitly be obtained when training on huge amounts of data, in a few-shot learning context where little data is available, making explicit use of the label structure can inform the model to reshape the representation space to reflect a global sense of class dependencies.   We propose a meta-learning framework, Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML), that conditionally transforms feature representations based on a metric space that is trained to capture inter-class dependencies. This enables a conditional modulation of the feature representations of the base-learner to impose regularities informed by the label space. Experiments show that the conditional transformation in CAML leads to more disentangled representations and achieves competitive results on the miniImageNet benchmark.","target":"CAML is an instance of MAML with conditional class dependencies","rationale":"The abstract highlights the novel contributions of this work, which involves developing a meta-learning framework called Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML), that conditionally transforms feature representations based on a metric space trained to capture inter-class dependencies.

Mice were orally treated for 9 consecutive days starting on the day of infection with daily ATA doses of 50 and 100 mmol/kg. Paromomycin (100 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Results: In both in vitro models, ATA at concentrations of 100 and 10 mmol/L completely inhibited sporozoites within 10 and 60 min, respectively. Viability of oocysts exposed to 100 mmol/L and assessed by flow cytometry and in cell culture was reduced by 65% and 61%, respectively. The treatment of neonatal mice with a daily ATA dose of 100 mmol/kg led to 97-99% inhibition of infection without any observable negative effects on the animals.

In 1840, it completed the state capitol building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large plantations were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of Virginia, Georgia, or South Carolina, significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and Durham in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \\"yeoman\\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129-mile (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a \\"farmer's railroad\\", from Fayetteville in the east to Bethania (northwest of Winston-Salem).\\n\\nTitle:","target":"North Carolina","rationale":"The title of the article is North Carolina.

The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.

This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. For example, if a bowl of fruit contains eight oranges and six lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Thus, a ratio can be a fraction as opposed to a whole number. Also, in this example the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4), and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).\\n\\n- Cosmology (from the Greek , \\"kosmos\\" \\"world\\" and -, \\"-logia\\" \\"study of\\") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities. \\n\\n- The number is a mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159.

It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.\\n\\n- Sir Thomas Gresham (\\"c.\\" 1519  21 November 1579), \\"Thomas Gresham the Elder\\", was an English merchant and financier who acted on behalf of King Edward VI (1547-1553) and Edward's half-sisters, queens Mary I (1553-1558) and Elizabeth I (1558-1603).\\n\\n- The circumference (from Latin \\"circumferentia\\", meaning \\"carrying around\\") of a closed curve or circular object is the linear distance around its edge. The circumference of a circle is of special importance in geometry and trigonometry. Informally \\"circumference\\" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge. Circumference is a special case of perimeter: the perimeter is the length around any closed figure, but conventionally \\"perimeter\\" is typically used in reference to a polygon while \\"circumference\\" typically refers to a continuously differentiable curve.\\n\\n- Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.\\n\\n- A supernova is an astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion.

As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: A chef is currently cooking two sausages on different skillets on different burners.

Some stories can be traced back to their roots, while the origin of others is uncertain or disputed. England abounds with folklore, in all forms, from such obvious manifestations as the traditional Robin Hood tales, the Brythonic-inspired Arthurian legend, to contemporary urban legends and facets of cryptozoology such as the Beast of Bodmin Moor.\\n\\n- Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who, according to legend, was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. Traditionally depicted as being dressed in Lincoln green, he is often portrayed as \\"robbing from the rich and giving to the poor\\" alongside his band of Merry Men. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure in the late-medieval period, and continues to be widely represented in literature, films and television.\\n\\n- In historical legal systems, an outlaw is declared as outside the protection of the law. In pre-modern societies, the criminal is withdrawn all legal protection, so that anyone is legally empowered to persecute or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In early Germanic law, the death penalty is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from Roman law, as the status of \\"homo sacer\\", and persisted throughout the Middle Ages.\\n\\n- A sword is a long bladed weapon intended for slashing or thrusting. The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A sword consists of a long blade attached to a hilt. The blade can be straight or curved. Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing.\\n\\n- Lincoln green is the colour of dyed woollen cloth associated with Robin Hood and his merry men in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The dyers of Lincoln, a cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the cloth by dyeing it with woad (\\"Isatis tinctoria\\") to give it a strong blue, then overdyeing it yellow with weld (\\"Reseda luteola\\") or dyers' broom, \\"Genista tinctoria\\". \\"Coventry blue\\" and \\"Kendall green\\" were also colours linked with the dyers of English towns.\\n\\n- A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good.\\n\\n- The Merry Men are the group of outlaws who follow Robin Hood in English literature and folklore .

He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger's playing \\"revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight\\".  In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a \\"love-serve job\\". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced \\"an overpowering landslide\\" of feeling, and that \\"I thought I was about to die.

He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?'

Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"All Around My Hat\\". They had four Top 40 albums and achieved a certified gold record with sales of \\"All Around My Hat\\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes.\\n\\nFor much of the 1980s, the members of the band tended to focus on outside projects of various sorts. Johnson opened a restaurant and then studied for a degree in psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. Pegrum ran a music studio. Prior and Kemp devoted much energy to their own band (The Maddy Prior Band; see Maddy Prior (solo albums)), recording 4 albums, and also had children together. The result was that the band's output dropped sharply, producing only three albums over the space of ten years (including a concert album), although the band continued touring.  After a quiet spell, the group's 12th studio album (and first without Tim Hart) Back in Line was released on the Flutterby label in 1986. With no \\"relaunch\\" as such, the band retained a low profile, although their recording of \\"Blackleg Miner\\" (previously an obscure song from an 1844 strike) became a political anthem for the NUM during the miners' strike of 1984-5 and was used to intimidate working miners. Steeleye Span continued to perform the song live and included a different version on their 1986 release Back in Line, which put greater stress on the line that threatens death against blacklegs.  In 1989, two long-term members departed. One was bassist Rick Kemp, who needed to recover from a serious shoulder injury, exacerbated by playing bass on stage. His eventual replacement (after two tours, each with a different bassist) was Tim Harries, who was brought in less than two weeks before the band was scheduled to start a tour. A friend of Pegrum's, Harries was a self-taught rock bassist, as well as a classically trained pianist and double bassist. With Harries on board, Steeleye released Tempted and Tried (1989), an album that formed the basis for their live set for many years to come.  Not long after recording Tempted, drummer Nigel Pegrum emigrated to Australia for personal relationship reasons. He was replaced by eccentric drummer Liam Genockey of Gillan, easily identified by his long, plaited beard. He and Knight were simultaneously members of \\"Moire Music\\", a free-jazz band with a classical flavour, led by Trevor Watts. Unlike Pegrum, who employed a traditional rock drumming style, Genockey favoured a more varied drumming style, influenced by both Irish and African drumming, in which he hit, brushed, and rubbed the various surfaces of his drums and cymbals, creating a more varied range of sounds. Consequently, when the band embarked on their 20th Anniversary Tour, they did so with a totally new rhythm section.  Both Harries and Genockey were interested in experimenting with the band's sound, and they helped re-energise the other members' interest in Steeleye. The band began reworking some of their earlier material, seeking new approaches to traditional favourites. For example, Johnson experimented with an arrangement of \\"Tam Lin\\" that involved a heavy Bulgarian influence, inspired by Eastern European versions of the Tam Lin legend. In 1992, the band released Tonight's the Night...Live, which demonstrates some of this new energy and direction. The band continued to tour the UK every year, and frequently toured overseas as well.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Steeleye Span","rationale":"The given context is all about the band Steeleye Span. \\nThus, it can be inferred that \\"Steeleye Span\\" would be a good answer to this question"},{"source":"I have a new situation: Barb and Dee studied chemistry for a school project.

Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach.\\nContext: The Atlanta Hawks selected Maravich with the third pick in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft, where he played for coach Richie Guerin. He was not a natural fit in Atlanta, as the Hawks already boasted a top-notch scorer at the guard position in Lou Hudson. In fact, Maravich's flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center Walt Bellamy. And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team--a very large salary at that time.  Maravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest--good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Team honors. And he managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game. But the team stumbled to a 36-46 record--12 wins fewer than in the previous season. Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Knicks in the first round.  Maravich struggled somewhat during his second season. His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36-46 record. Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round. However, Atlanta fought hard against the Boston Celtics, with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.  Maravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA). With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season. The Hawks soared to a 46-36 record, but again bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the NBA All-Star Game, and also All-NBA Second Team honors.  The following season (1973-74) was his best yet--at least in terms of individual accomplishments. Maravich posted 27.7 points per game--second in the league behind Bob McAdoo--and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game. However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35-47 record and missed the postseason entirely.\\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?.

Born in Korumburra, Victoria, he was a dairy farmer at Warragul before serving in the military 194145. He was active in local politics as a member of Warragul Shire Council, and was elected to Gippsland Province in the Victorian Legislative Council for a six-year term at the 1964 state election. In 1972, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Country Party member for McMillan, despite receiving only 16.6% of the primary vote. This was one of the lowest primary votes achieved by a successful candidate, elected in a single seat electorate, in the history of Australian elections. His election was made possible by a strong flow of preferences from the Democratic Labor Party and from former Liberal member Alexander Buchanan, who was running as an independent after losing his Liberal endorsement to Barrie Armitage.\\n\\n- Alexander Andrew Buchanan (4 October 1905  10 September 1985) was an Australian politician. Born in Melbourne, he was educated there at Scotch College and then at the University of Melbourne. He became a manager and a manufacturing and wholesale merchant before serving in the military 194243. He returned to become a farmer at Beaconsfield and an organiser of the Liberal Party in Victoria. In 1955, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for McMillan. He held the seat until 1972, when he lost his Liberal Party endorsement and unsuccessfully contested the seat as an independent. His preferences were instrumental in the victory of the Country Party candidate in that year. Buchanan died in 1985.\\n\\n- Abortion law permits, prohibits, restricts, or otherwise regulates the availability of abortion. Abortion has been a controversial subject in many societies through history on religious, moral, ethical, practical, and political grounds. It has been banned frequently and otherwise limited by law. However, abortions continue to be common in many areas, even where they are illegal. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), abortion rates are similar in countries where the procedure is legal and in countries where it is not, due to unavailability of modern contraceptives in areas where abortion is illegal. The number of abortions worldwide is declining due to increased access to contraception according to WHO. Almost two-thirds of the world's women currently reside in countries where abortion may be obtained on request for a broad range of social, economic, or personal reasons. Abortion laws vary widely by nation. Four countries in Latin America (Chile, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Nicaragua), in addition to Malta and Vatican City in Europe, ban the procedure entirely. Abortion in Canada is available to women without any legal restrictions, while in the Republic of Ireland abortions are illegal except when a woman's life is at imminent risk.\\n\\n- The Yarra Valley is the name given to the region surrounding the Yarra River in Victoria, Australia. The river originates approximately 90 kilometres east of the Melbourne central business district and flows towards it and out into Port Phillip Bay. The name Yarra Valley is used in reference to the upper regions surrounding the Yarra River and generally does not encompass the lower regions including the city and suburban areas, where the topography flattens out, or the upper reaches which are in inaccessible bushland. Included in the Yarra Valley is the sub-region of Upper Yarra (or the Upper Yarra Valley) which encompasses the towns of the former Shire of Upper Yarra in the catchment area upstream of and including Woori Yallock. The Yarra Valley is a popular day-trip and tourist area, featuring a range of natural features and agricultural produce, as well as the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail.\\n\\n- The right to life is a moral principle based on the belief that a human being has the right to live and, in particular, should not be killed by another human being. The concept of a right to life arises in debates on issues of capital punishment, war, abortion, euthanasia, justifiable homicide and, by extension, public health care.\\n\\n- The University of Melbourne (informally Melbourne University) is a public research university located in Melbourne, Australia. Founded in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria. Times Higher Education ranks Melbourne as 33rd in the world, while the Academic Ranking of World Universities places Melbourne 40th in the world (both first in Australia). \\n\\n- Miscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion and pregnancy loss, is the natural death of an embryo or fetus before it is able to survive independently. Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth. The most common symptoms of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain. Sadness, anxiety and guilt may occur. Tissue or clot-like material may also come out of the vagina.\\nRisk factors for miscarriage include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, and drug or alcohol use, among others. In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40. Risk begins to increase around the age of 30. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve checking to see if the cervix is open or closed, testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound.\\nPrevention is occasionally possible with good prenatal care. Avoiding drugs and alcohol, infectious diseases, and radiation may prevent miscarriage. No specific treatment is usually needed during the first 7 to 14 days. Most miscarriage will complete without additional interventions. Occasionally the medication misoprostol or a procedure such as vacuum aspiration is required to remove the failed pregnancy. Women who are rhesus negative may require Rho(D) immune globulin. Pain medication may be beneficial. Emotional support may help with negative emotions.\\nMiscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Among females who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20% while rates among all fertilisation is around 30% to 50%. About 5% of females have two miscarriages in a row.

The name \\"Melbourne\\" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians.\\n\\n- The Victorian Legislative Council (VLC) is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Victoria, Australia; the lower house being the Legislative Assembly. Both houses sit at Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. The Legislative Council serves as a house of review, in a similar fashion to its federal counterpart, the Australian Senate. Although it is possible for legislation to be first introduced in the Council, most bills receive their first hearing in the Legislative Assembly.\\n\\n- Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by removing a fetus or embryo before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion which occurs spontaneously is also known as a miscarriage. An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an induced abortion, or less frequently, \\"induced miscarriage\\". The word \\"abortion\\" is often used to mean only induced abortions. A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a \\"late termination of pregnancy\\".\\nWhen allowed by local law, abortion in the developed world is one of the safest procedures in medicine. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The World Health Organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.\\nAround 56 million abortions occur each year in the world, with a little under half done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 40% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.\\nSince ancient times, abortions have been done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other traditional methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest.

They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.\\n\\nAnswer this question please: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B?","target":"crop B","rationale":"The context of the situation is that Dan used genetic engineering to develop a new crop, \\"crop A\\", which is resistant to herbicides. In order to determine how much better it performed than an older version of his crop (\\"crop B\\"), he compared them and found that \\"herbicide tolerant\\" crops required fewer chemicals during growth.\\nSo, based on this information, we can conclude that Crop B would need more number of chemicals because it was not genetically engineered for resistance against toxic herbicides."},{"source":"In this task, you are given dialogue, and you have to find the most critical location in the given conversation.\\n\\nHello, what can you tell me about Bolivia? \\n Bolivia, which is officially the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. \\n What do you know about Economy? \\n In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former president of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, Cochabamba. Bolivia has the second largest natural gas reserves in South America. \\n Great, any other interesting fact about the economy? \\n The amount in reserve currencies and gold held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1,085 billion US dollars in 2000, under Hugo Banzer Suarze's government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under Evo Morales' government. \\n Do you know how much is now? \\n Sorry, I do not know that exact answer, however, I can tell you a little bit more about their economy. Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. A surplus budget of 1.7 GDP was obtained by 2012, the government runs surpluses since Morales administration reflecting prudent economic management. \\n That is very good period for them, how is the situation now? \\n Sorry, I do not have that information available at this time, however, I can tell you that by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentia of natural gas. \\n Great, tell me about the demographics? \\n Of course!

In Britain, most families have at least one car and this car is used every day. It could be that only one person in the family drives the car to work or for shopping. The number of cars on the road which are almost empty perhaps helps to explain why the oil is used up so quickly. The family car is a very useful form of transport but it is also a great waste of energy, especially if it is compared with buses or trains. Much petrol is used by a car which is traveling at 120 kilometers an hour.

For detecting or genotyping of FCoV, some RT-PCR plus nested PCR techniques have been reported previously. However, referring to the whole genome sequences (WGSs) registered at NCBI, there are no detection methods that can tolerate the genetic diversity among FCoV population. In addition, the quasispecies nature of FCoV, which consists of heterogeneous variants, has been also demonstrated; thus, a universal method for heteropopulations of FCoV variants in clinical specimens is desirable. Results: To develop an RT-PCR method for detection and genotyping of FCoV, we performed comparative genome analysis using WGSs of 32 FCoV, 7 CCoV and 5 TGEV strains obtained from NCBI. As the PCR target, we focused on the nsp14 coding region, which is highly conserved and phylogenetically informative, and developed a PCR method targeting nsp14 partial sequences. Among 103 ascites, 45 pleural effusion and 214 blood specimens from clinically ill cats, we could detect FCoV in 55 (53.4%), 14 (31.1%) and 19 (8.9%) specimens using the present method. Direct sequencing of PCR products and phylogenetic analysis allowed discrimination between type I-and II-FCoV serotypes. Our nsp14 amino acid sequence typing (nsp14 aa ST) showed that the FCoV clone with sequence type (ST) 42, which was the most predominant genotype of WGS strains, was prevalent in domestic cats in Japan. Conclusions: Our nsp14 PCR scheme will contribute to virus detection, epidemiology and ecology of FCoV strains.","target":"Molecular epidemiological study of feline coronavirus strains in Japan using RT-PCR targeting nsp14 gene","rationale":"The title should reflect the content of this article, which describes a new method for detecting and genotyping FCoV that is applicable to heterogeneous populations of variants in clinical specimens.

', ), officially the Republic of Belarus, formerly known by its Russian name Byelorussia (though this name is no longer used in Belarus itself, even in Russian language), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire.\\n\\n- The Danube (, known by various names in other languages) is Europe's second-longest river, after the Volga River, and also the longest river in the European Union region. It is located in Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\n- Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country.\\n\\n- Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.\\n\\n- Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\\n\\n- The Sea of Azov (\\"Azovs'ke more/Azovke more\\") is a sea in Eastern Europe. To the south it is linked by the narrow (about ) Strait of Kerch to the Black Sea, and it is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea. The sea is bounded in the north by mainland Ukraine, in the east by Russia, and in the west by the Crimean Peninsula. The Don and Kuban are the major rivers that flow into it. The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world, with the depth varying between .

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nand the situation: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift.

Th odore, a winner of the Prix de Rome and a knight of the Legion of Honor, is famous for his interiors and chiaroscuro effects in imitation of the Dutch School. He makes an excellent reproduction of the interior of the Cat and Racket, which is exhibited at the Salon alongside a strikingly modern portrait of Augustine. The affair blossoms with the help of Madame Guillaume's younger cousin Madame Roguin, who is already acquainted with Th odore. The lovers become engaged, somewhat against the best wishes of Augustine's parents, who had originally intended her to marry Monsieur Guillaume's clerk Joseph Lebas. In 1808 Augustine marries Th odore at the local church of Saint-Leu; on the same day her elder sister Virginie marries Lebas.\\nThe marriage is not a happy one. Augustine adores Sommervieux but is incapable of understanding him as an artist. Although she is more refined than her parents, her education and social standing leave her too far below the level of her husband to allow a meeting of minds to take place. Th odore's passion for her cools and she is treated with disdain by his fellow artists. Th odore instead finds a kindred soul in the Duchesse de Carigliano, to whom he gives the famous portrait of Augustine and to whom he becomes hopelessly attached, neglecting his rooms on the Rue des Trois-Fr res (now a part of the Rue Taitbout).\\nRealizing after three years of unhappiness that her marriage is falling apart and having been informed by a malicious gossip of Th odore's attachment to the duchess, Augustine visits Madame de Carigliano not to ask her to give her back her husband's heart but to learn the arts by which it has been captured. The duchess warns her against trying to conquer a man's heart through love, which will only allow the husband to tyrannize over the wife; instead a woman must use all the arts of coquetry that nature puts at her disposal. Augustine is shocked to learn that Madame de Carigliano sees marriage as a form of warfare. The duchess then returns to Augustine her own portrait, telling her that if she cannot conquer her husband with this weapon, she is not a woman.\\nAugustine, however, does not understand how to turn such a weapon against her husband. She hangs the portrait in her bedroom and dresses herself exactly as she appears in it, believing that Th odore will see her once again as the young woman he fell in love with at the sign of the Cat and Racket. But when the artist sees the portrait hanging in her bedroom and asks how it came to be there, she foolishly reveals that it was returned to her by the Duchesse de Carigliano. \\"You demanded it from her?\\" he asks. \\"I did not know that she had it\\", replies Augustine. Th odore realizes that his wife is incapable of seeing the painting as he sees it - a consummate work of art. Instead of falling in love with its subject, he regards its return as a slap in the face from his mistress. His vanity wounded, he throws a fit and destroys the portrait, vowing vengeance upon the duchess.\\nBy morning Augustine has become resigned to her fate. Her loveless marriage comes to an end shortly thereafter when she dies of a broken heart at the age of twenty-seven.","target":"Why does Augustine go to visit the Duchesse de Carigliano?","rationale":"Here is a good question: Why does Augustine go to visit the Duchesse de Carigliano?"},{"source":"Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage.

Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended 2.5 miles (4 km) in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists..., what would be the answer ?","target":"42","rationale":"The answer is 42. The rationale is that the article mentions “41 or 42 people died in the incident”, so 41 and 42 are both potential answers to this question.

Platelet aggregation is a large component in the formation of arterial thrombi. In pharmacologic studies, aspirin has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and, therefore, might be expected to prevent coronary occlusion. These effects are apparent in the dose range of l00-l000 mg/day, and may be most evident at l60 milligrams daily. Higher doses seem to be no more effective in either inhibition of platelet agreeability or prolonged bleeding time. Although an early case-control study by Jick and Miettinen showed a large benefit, most observational studies had shown a cardiovascular benefit of about 20 percent. Conclusive data could only result from a randomized trial with a large sample size. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample. Participants were randomized into one of four treatment groups: one 325 milligram aspirin tablet every other day, alternating with one 30 milligram capsule of beta-carotene; one aspirin every other day, alternating with one capsule of beta-carotene placebo; one aspirin placebo tablet every other day, alternating with one capsule of beta-carotene; and one aspirin placebo tablet every other day, alternating with one capsule of beta-carotene placebo.

His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be remarkably well preserved when moved in 1840.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injection for children with neuropathic bladders that are resistant to anticholinergic treatment, and to reveal any criteria indicating treatment success.', 'Hospital records were reviewed of 16 children with neuropathic bladders due to myelomeningocele, and who had botulinum toxin A injections between 2007 and 2010. Botulinum toxin A (10 units/kg) was injected endoscopically into various sites of the detrusor, except the trigone. The success was defined as complete dryness between clean intermittent catheterizations. Urodynamic studies before and after the application were evaluated and parameters, including bladder capacity (measured/expected) and compliance, were also analyzed. Reviewing the results, patients were then classified into two groups: as having fibrotic bladders (noncompliant, acontractile bladders with high pressures) or overactive bladders. Urodynamic findings and therapy success were then compared between the groups.', 'A total of 19 injections, including repeat injections in three patients, were performed. Results of the 16 initial injections were evaluated. Nine patients had detrusor overactivity, and five out of nine (56%) applications in this group resulted in complete dryness between clean intermittent catheterizations. In bladders with typical detrusor overactivity, there was a significant increase in both the capacity (from 0.53 to 0.74) and compliance (from 4.7 to 8.6 ml/cm H2O). Looking at the seven patients that displayed fibrotic bladders with very low compliance and no contraction at all, none of them presented with notable clinical improvement from injections. Comparing the urodynamic findings, there was no significant difference in compliance (3.1 ml/cm H2O before and 3.5 ml/cm H2O after) and bladder capacity (0.58 before and 0.52 after the treatment) in the fibrotic bladders.","target":"1","rationale":"The purpose of the study is described in the first sentence: \\"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injection for children with neuropathic bladders that are resistant to anticholinergic treatment, and to reveal any criteria indicating treatment success.\\" This sentence provides an objective for the study, which is considered a definate objective/aim/goal.

Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history.

In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming.

In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.\\nWe tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the work force was unemployed, it had declined by around 25 percent from 1929. But this does not mean that people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes plummeting and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared that neither would be able to manage alone.\\nToday, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes. \\nAfter financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities.

According to a recent study, the more you struggle while you are learning new information, the better you can remember it later.\\nThis theory might surprise you. When teachers are presenting new information, they often give students lots of help. But a new study shows this may not be the best way to support learning. \\"Don't be too quick to get help when learning something new,\\" education expert Manu Kapur told TFK. \\"Try to work on it yourself even if it means trying different ways.\\"\\nKapur came up with the idea that struggling can lead to better learning. Then he tested it out on students in Singapore. He separated students into two groups. In the first group, students were asked to solve math problems with the teacher's help. In the second group, students were asked to solve the same problems by helping one another, instead of getting help from the teacher.\\nWith the teacher's help, students in the first group were able to find the correct answers. Students in the second group did not solve the problems correctly. But they did come up with a lot of good ideas. The students were then tested on what they had learned. The group without any help from a teacher scored much higher than the group who had help. Kapur said working to find the answers helped students understand the process, not just the solution.\\nKapur's advice for kids is to put a lot of effort into learning something new rather than going to your teacher for help. \\"Simply doing a little work or nothing at all won't work,\\" says Kapur. \\"The struggle needs to be a genuine attempt to figure out or solve a problem in as many ways as possible.\\"\\nQuestion: When you have doubt on schoolwork, you'd better   _  .\\nOptions: A: ask your teacher for help\\nB: make it clear by yourself\\nC: ask your classmates to help you\\nD: ask your parents for help","target":"B","rationale":"The article states that the more a student struggles with new information, the better he or she will be able to remember it later. The key is to put in effort and try different ways of approaching an issue without getting help from any other person.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\".\\nQuestion: Where does Nemo lack all control ?\\nTitle: Mr. Nobody\\nMovie plot: Mr. Nobody is a tale about choice. Nemo, a nine year old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision - to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the films main problem (not knowing the future) once solved makes it all the more difficult - \\"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one\\". The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in story line, between young boy, adolescent man, and mature man. Corresponding to each particular stage is a certain soundtrack. The movie takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way - every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.\\nThe film also makes good use of chaos theory, string theory and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control we as individuals possess. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where we lacks all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The aforementioned theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. At the end when you assume that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, time halts, and it begins to reverse.

The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships, planes, and trained aircrew. At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy, a good aircrew training program, or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, fell further and further behind. In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured; some, like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by air attack and bypassed. The goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks, improve the submarine blockade, and finally (only if necessary) execute an invasion.","target":"submarine blockade","rationale":"The context states that the United States used its resources to increase numbers of ships, planes and trained aircrew in preparation for battle.

The goal was to launch massive strategic air attacks on each stronghold until they reached the final destination - an invasion if necessary. Finally, it is mentioned that submarine blockade was one approach during this time period as well.\\nSo we can infer from these pieces of information together that submarine blockade could be considered part of navy standing by during the air attacks (as opposed to non-navy forces).

Though deep learning leads to groundbreaking performance in these domains, the networks used are very demanding computationally and are far from real-time even on a GPU, which is not power efficient and therefore does not suit low power systems such as mobile devices. To overcome this challenge, some solutions have been proposed for quantizing the weights and activations of these networks, which accelerate the runtime significantly. Yet, this acceleration comes at the cost of a larger error. The NICE method proposed in this work trains quantized neural networks by noise injection and a learned clamping, which improve the accuracy. This leads to state-of-the-art results on various regression and classification tasks, e.g., ImageNet classification with architectures such as ResNet-18/34/50 with low as 3-bit weights and 3 -bit activations. We implement the proposed solution on an FPGA to demonstrate its applicability for low power real-time applications.","target":"Combine noise injection, gradual quantization and activation clamping learning to achieve state-of-the-art 3,4 and 5 bit quantization","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nCombine noise injection, gradual quantization and activation clamping learning to achieve state-of-the-art 3,4 and 5 bit quantization."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: Who was less highly ranked, Lord Elgin or Queen Victoria?\\nContext: In 1887, the British Empire celebrated Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

It is a mix of sugar, egg yolks and hot milk, often flavoured with vanilla. Its name may derive from the prevalence of sweet custards in English desserts.\\n\\n- Pudding is a kind of food that can be either a dessert or a savory dish. The word \\"pudding\\" is believed to come from the French \\"boudin\\", originally from the Latin \\"botellus,\\" meaning \\"small sausage\\", referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings.\\n\\n- Worcestershire (or ; written abbreviation: Worcs) is a county in the West Midlands of England. Between 1974 and 1998, it was merged with the neighbouring county of Herefordshire as Hereford and Worcester.\\n\\n- Hereford and Worcester was an English county created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 from the areas of the former administrative county of Herefordshire, most of Worcestershire (except Halesowen, Stourbridge and Warley, which became part of the West Midlands) and the county borough of Worcester. An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England's smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire's most urbanised areas to the West Midlands. The merger aroused much opposition from Herefordshire people, many of whom regarded it as not a merger but a takeover by Worcestershire.\\n\\n- Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \\"separators\\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets. Cream has high levels of saturated fat.\\n\\n- Corn starch, cornstarch, cornflour or maize starch or maize is the starch derived from the corn (maize) grain or wheat. The starch is obtained from the endosperm of the kernel. Corn starch is a popular food ingredient used in thickening sauces or soups, and is used in making corn syrup and other sugars.\\n\\n- Gelatin or gelatine (from meaning \\"stiff\\", \\"frozen\\") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food derived from collagen obtained from various animal raw materials. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called \\"gelatinous\\". Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller peptides, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. It is found in most gummy candy, as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin desserts, and some ice creams, dips, and yogurts. Gelatin for recipe use comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral.\\n\\n- In cooking, a sauce is liquid, cream, or semi-solid food served on or used in preparing other foods. Sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. \\"Sauce\\" is a French word taken from the Latin \\"salsa\\", meaning \\"salted\\". Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Greeks; while doubanjiang, the Chinese soy bean paste is mentioned in \\"Rites of Zhou\\" in 3rd century BC.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods such as potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.\\n\\n- Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\\n\\n- A gel is a solid jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute cross-linked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase. The word \\"gel\\" was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist Thomas Graham by clipping from \\"gelatine\\".\\n\\n- Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.\\n\\n- Quiche is a savoury, open-faced pastry crust with a filling of savoury custard with one or more of cheese, meat, seafood or vegetables. Quiche can be served hot or cold. It is part of French cuisine but is also popular in other countries, particularly as party food.\\n\\n- Dessert is a course that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, such as dessert wine or liqueurs, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\\n\\n- Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (\\"crème anglaise\\") to a thick pastry cream (French: \\"crème pâtissière\\") used to fill éclairs. Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla. Custard bases may also be used for quiches and other savory foods. Sometimes flour, corn starch, or gelatin is added as in pastry cream or \\"crème pâtissière\\".\\n\\n- Malvern pudding is a traditional pudding from the English town of Malvern in Worcestershire . It is a baked dish made with apples or other seasonal fruit and custard although variations exist . It was listed as one of the ten most \`\` threatened puddings '' after a survey conducted by UKTV Food .\\n\\n- Herefordshire (abbreviated Herefs. or Hfds.) is a historic English county in the West Midlands. It is a ceremonial county and a unitary non-metropolitan county and district, also named in legislation as the County of Herefordshire and governed by Herefordshire Council. It borders the English ceremonial counties of Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south-east, and the Welsh preserved counties of Gwent to the south-west and Powys to the west. The Welsh unitary county covering the part of Gwent next to Herefordshire is Monmouthshire.\\n\\n- Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'malvern pudding' has the relation 'has part' with?","target":"egg","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"egg\\"."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: Going to another place is a form of?\\nContext: Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad.

They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels are crucial for modern human society. Fossil fuels are essential for transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources tend to be clean. They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems. They are more costly and less efficient than fossil fuels. Still, they have many advantages. Research is going into developing renewable resources. Conservation is the best way to increase resource availability. Anyone can conserve! You and your family can. Society can. The world can. Just reduce, reuse, recycle.","target":"Russia","rationale":"Germany is the leader in using renewable resources. It means they are assured of having enough natural resouces to meet their needs forever, or at least for a very long time. Russia has huge gas and oil reserves which will last maybe 100 years if not more.

His father was Ernest Lewis , one of the founding directors of the Army & Navy Stores ( United Kingdom ) . On 14 September 1914 Major Geoffrey Salmond , CO of No.3 Sqdn and Captain Donald Swain Lewis carried out a successful experiment with a Royal artillery battery using a radio transmitter to communicate the fall of artillery shells . Lewis is also credited with creating the \`\` grid square '' map system which revolutionized British wartime cartography . This was probably not an Ordnance Survey style grid based on a system of mile or kilometre squaring , but a system based on squares identified by letters and numbers . In the Battle of the Aisne ( September -- October 1914 ) , Lewis squared two copies of a 1:80,000 map , keeping one copy for himself for observing from the air , and giving a second copy to a battery commander with whom he was in wireless communication . On 15 September the British Third Corps assigned its RFC squadrons to support the divisional heavy & howitzer batteries .

During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.\\n\\n- The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.\\n\\n- The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'conflict'.","target":"donald swain lewis , world war i","rationale":"The information mentions that the Central Powers faced and were defeated by Allied Powers.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection.\\nThe setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles.

I'm a full-time student and he works, making the time difference harder but we persist. I text him during my classes and he texts me whenever he can from work. We started off just flirting super over the top when we met through a friend, but now we talk daily for hours on end. We were video-calling a few weeks back, and his roommate basically assumed I was his girlfriend, which he didn't accept or deny. While I was on vacation for two weeks, I didn't talk to anyone in our groupchat except him. We exchange good mornings for both of our time zones and if we don't fall asleep mid-conversation, we say good night. He can sense when my emotions are off and will make sure I'm alright and not upset, and will stay up helping cheer me up. He puts up with my quirks and flaws, and is genuinely an amazing guy, almost perfect for me.\\n\\nI've had friends ask what our thing was before and I just answer vaguely, saying i don't know, we don't really have a label. I just talk about how I'm always smiling when talking with him and that he makes me happy.

I'm not the type of person to bring up the \\"What are we?\\" discussion and I don't think he is either. And even if I do bring it up, I'm scared of ruining our happiness. We joke about kids and marriage, because neither of us are ready for that yet, but neither of us are opposed to that in the future as a possibility. We joke and imply sexual stuff a lot but haven't done anything sexual. I personally shy away a little because I'm scared of oversexualizing things and ruining the potential relationship, but I'm not against it. \\n\\nHowever, we always talk about visiting each other and going on dates and dinners and cuddling, so I feel like this isn't just something small.

From the lords and ladies in their castles to the peasants on the mountainsides, over half the people were Cathars. Now this year, one thousand two hundred forty-four, might come to be remembered as the year Catharism in France disappeared.

So not only does this make us believe that the person who is preparing to leave is probably Diane, but even more so because Roland (the other character in question) was made ready for travel by having his cross sewn back onto his black surcoat (which would have been taken off during his imprisonment). \\nThe answer is therefore \\"Diane\\" since we can infer from both characters' situations whether they are traveling or staying based on how they were prepared"},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

They became so popular that by the middle of the 19th century, some 1.3 billion British pounds a year were being spent on Valentine's Day gifts.\\nWhat led to the true popularization of Valentine's Day?\\nA) The British publishing company's selling cards.\\nB) The poems of Geoffrey Chaucer.\\nC) One Valentine's death.\\nD) The mysterious story.","target":"A","rationale":"The text mentions that Valentine's Day was popularized in the late 18th century, when a British publishing company began selling paper cards inscribed with romantic words.

Though often described as a solo or side project, Slash stated that Snakepit was a band with equal contributions by all members. The first lineup of the band consisted of Slash, two of his Guns N' Roses bandmates-- drummer Matt Sorum and guitarist Gilby Clarke-- as well as Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez and former Jellyfish live guitarist Eric Dover on lead vocals.\\n\\nThe band began recording material with producer Jack Douglas at Slash's home studio as well as Ocean Way Studios. The recording featured contributions by Teddy Andreadis, Jimmy Zavala and Lee Thornburg, amongst others. Initially, the label was positive about the album, setting a release date for February 22, 2000. However, when Slash was informed by Geffen, who had folded into Interscope Records, that the album was not the type of music the label produced, he bought the album back and signed a deal with Koch Records. Following the completion of the album, Roxie departed the band with former Big Bang Babies, Warrant and Ratt guitarist Keri Kelli joining in his place.  Ain't Life Grand was released on October 20, 2000 through Koch with \\"Mean Bone\\" released as the first single. The album did not sell as well as its predecessor, and critical reception to it was mixed. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tony Scherman stated that \\"Slash's playing is as flashily incendiary as ever, but the songs and arrangements recycle hard-rock cliches worthier of Ratt than of a bona fide guitar god\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that \\"great guitarists need great bands, and the Snakepit dudes are barely functional backup peons\\". Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that \\"the new Snakepit does kick up a lot of noise as the album rushes by, and the strong chemistry between the members is immediately obvious\\". However, he stated that songwriting was the main problem, and that \\"it never rises above the level of solid, and too many tracks are by-the-numbers hard rock at best (and pedestrian at worst)\\". The band were dropped by Koch two months following the album's release.  Prior to the album's release, Slash's Snakepit supported AC/DC on their Stiff Upper Lip tour from August to September, followed by their own headlining tour of theatres. They played only the first two shows on the winter leg of AC/DC's tour. After falling ill and checking into a hospital in Pittsburgh, Slash was ordered by his doctor to stay at home to recuperate, reportedly from pneumonia. Due to this, Slash's Snakepit pulled out of supporting AC/DC in early 2001. Slash later revealed in his self-titled biography that he had actually suffered cardiac myopathy caused by years of alcohol and drug abuse, with his heart swelling to the point of rupture. After being fitted with a defibrillator and undergoing physical therapy, Slash returned to the group to continue touring. They later rescheduled their US tour, performing shows from June 16 - July 6, co-headlining three shows with Billy Idol. Following the tour, feeling that his band was unprofessional and his bandmates were not fully committed, Slash disbanded Slash's Snakepit in an announcement made in early 2002.\\n\\nDid the album include any hit even thought it didn't do well?","target":"\\"Mean Bone","rationale":"From the given context, it is clear that \\"Mean Bone\\" was released as a single prior to the release of Ain't Life Grand. \\nWhen we search for this album online (on wikipedia or AllMusic), we can see (\\"[...] with Mean Bone released as its lead single.\\")."},{"source":"Read the given text and if it has abusive content then indicate via \\"yes\\".

Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"high rates of literacy","rationale":"The context in the question says that Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management and financial services.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994.

Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the 'hockey stick graph'. This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007.

Wōdejebato is probably a shield volcano and is connected through a submarine ridge to the smaller Pikinni Atoll 74 kilometres (46 mi) southeast of the guyot; unlike Wōdejebato, Pikinni rises above sea level. The seamount rises for 4,420 metres (14,500 ft) to 1,335 metres (4,380 ft) depth and is formed by basaltic rocks. The name Wōdejebato refers to a sea god of Pikinni.\\nIt was probably formed by a hotspot in what is present-day French Polynesia before plate tectonics moved it to its present-day location. The Macdonald, Rarotonga, Rurutu and Society hotspots may have been involved in its formation. The first volcanic phase took place in the Cenomanian and was followed by the formation of a carbonate platform that quickly disappeared below the sea. A second volcanic episode between 85 and 78.4 million years ago (in the Campanian) led to the formation of an island. This island was eventually eroded and rudist reefs generated an atoll or atoll-like structure, covering the former island with carbonates and thus a second carbonate platform.\\nThe second carbonate platform drowned about 68 million years ago (in the Maastrichtian), perhaps because at that time it was moving through the equatorial area which may have been too hot or too nutrient-rich to support the growth of a coral reef.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods.\\nCombining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.\\nTeasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken.\\nSalt promotes over-eating\\nEleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces.

Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists from days to weeks prior to recovery.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the number of viruses that are recognized as the type of virus that poliovirus is.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two farmers, Tom and Brad, applied different farming methods.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.","target":"Vulgate Cycle","rationale":"The answer is the Vulgate Cycle.\\nAs per wiki, it says: \\"the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds.

Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators.

In reality, current algorithms often make highly confident yet wrong predictions when faced with unexpected test samples from an unknown distribution different from training. Unlike domain adaptation methods, we cannot gather an \\"unexpected dataset\\" prior to test, and unlike novelty detection methods, a best-effort original task prediction is still expected. We compare a number of methods from related fields such as calibration and epistemic uncertainty modeling, as well as two proposed methods that reduce overconfident errors of samples from an unknown novel distribution without drastically increasing evaluation time: (1) G-distillation, training an ensemble of classifiers and then distill into a single model using both labeled and unlabeled examples, or (2) NCR, reducing prediction confidence based on its novelty detection score. Experimentally, we investigate the overconfidence problem and evaluate our solution by creating \\"familiar\\" and \\"novel\\" test splits, where \\"familiar\\" are identically distributed with training and \\"novel\\" are not. We discover that calibrating using temperature scaling on familiar data is the best single-model method for improving novel confidence, followed by our proposed methods. In addition, some methods' NLL performance are roughly equivalent to a regularly trained model with certain degree of smoothing. Calibrating can also reduce confident errors, for example, in gender recognition by 95% on demographic groups different from the training data.","target":"Deep networks are more likely to be confidently wrong when testing on unexpected data.

The appeal was the third round through Italy's grinding, multi-level legal system, with its numerous checks and balances. But the saga is also confusing because, while the crime is simple, the case built around it is a grand spectacle combining aspects of national pride, sexist archetypes and race. Knox and her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, were first convicted by a jury in 2009 for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007. An appellate judge overturned the conviction in 2011 and Knox returned to the United States after four years in jail. The prosecutor then appealed the acquittal to the Italian Supreme Court, which sent the case to the new appellate panel that reinstated the conviction.\\n@highlight\\nNina Burleigh: Guilty verdict-- again--for Amanda Knox baffles Americans for good reason\\n@highlight\\nShe says Italian prosecutors still lack evidence, but unwilling to admit mistake, reframe case\\n@highlight\\nShe says far more ties just Rudy Guede to murder.

Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school.
