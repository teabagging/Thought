During this period, which has become known as baseball's dead-ball era, Cub infielders Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance were made famous as a double-play combination by Franklin P.

The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus.

We need them for food and clothing, for building materials and energy. We even need them to have fun. Table 20.1 gives examples of how we use natural resources. Can you think of other ways we use natural resources? Use Vehicles Resources Rubber for tires from rubber trees Steel frames and other metal parts from minerals such as iron Example iron ore Use Electronics Resources Plastic cases from petroleum prod- ucts Glass screens from minerals such as lead Example lead ore Homes Nails from minerals such as iron Timber from trees spruce timber Jewelry Gemstones such as diamonds Minerals such as silver silver ore Food Sunlight, water, and soil Minerals such as phosphorus corn seeds in soil Clothing Wool from sheep Cotton from cotton plants cotton plants Recreation Water for boating and swimming Forests for hiking and camping pine forest Some natural resources are renewable. Others are not. It depends in part on how we use them. Renewable resources can be renewed as they are used. An example is timber, which comes from trees. New trees can be planted to replace those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we will never run out of that! Just because a resource is renewable, it doesnt mean we should use it carelessly. If we arent careful, we can pollute resources. Then they may no longer be fit for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a water source it may not be usable for drinking, bathing or any other type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In this case the resources may not be able to recover. For example, fish are renewable resources. Thats because they can reproduce and make more fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low. Figure 20.1 shows another example. Some resources cant be renewed. At least, they cant be renewed fast enough to keep up with use. Fossil fuels are examples. It takes millions of years for them to form. We are using them up much more quickly. Elements that are used to produce nuclear power are other examples. They include uranium. This element is already rare. Sooner or later, it will run out. Supplies of non-renewable resources are shrinking. This makes them harder to get. Oil is a good example. Oil reserves beneath land are running out. So oil companies have started to drill for oil far out in the ocean. This costs more money. Its also more dangerous. Figure 20.2 shows an oil rig that exploded in 2010. The explosion killed 11 people. Millions of barrels of oil spilled into the water. It took months to plug the leak. Rich nations use more natural resources than poor nations. In fact, the richest 20 percent of people use 85 percent of the worlds resources. What about the poorest 20 percent of people? They use only 1 percent of the worlds resources. You can see this unequal distribution of oil resources in Figure 20.3. Imagine a world in which everybody had equal access to resources. Some people would have fewer resources than they do now. But many people would have more. In the real world, the difference between rich and poor just keeps growing. Every 20 minutes, the human population adds 3,500 more people. More people need more resources. For example, we now use five times more fossil fuels than we did in 1970. The human population is expected to increase for at least 40 years. What will happen to resource use? How can we protect Earths natural resources? One answer is conservation. This means saving resources. We need to save resources so some will be left for the future. We also need to protect resources from pollution and overuse. When we conserve resources, we also cut down on the trash we produce. Americans throw out 340 million tons of trash each year. We throw out 2.5 million plastic bottles alone every hour! Most of what we throw out ends up in landfills. You can see a landfill in Figure 20.4.

Fixed cost -- Fixed costs are not permanently fixed; they will change over time, but are fixed in relation to the quantity of production for the relevant period. For example, a company may have unexpected and unpredictable expenses unrelated to production, such as warehouse costs and the like that are fixed only over the time period of the lease. By definition, there are no fixed costs in the long run, because the long run is a sufficient period of time for all short-run fixed inputs to become variable. Investments in facilities, equipment, and the basic organization that can't be significantly reduced in a short period of time are referred to as committed fixed costs.

They include fluids that are excreted or secreted from the body, and body water that normally is not.\\n\\n- Studies that are in vivo (Latin for \\"within the living\\"; often not italicized in English) are those in which the effects of various biological entities are tested on whole, living organisms, usually animals, including humans, and plants as opposed to a partial or dead organism. This is not to be confused with experiments done \\"in vitro\\" (\\"within the glass\\"), i.e., in a laboratory environment using test tubes, petri dishes, etc. Examples of investigations \\"in vivo\\" include: the pathogenesis of disease by comparing the effects of bacterial infection with the effects of purified bacterial toxins; the development of antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and new drugs generally; and new surgical procedures. Consequently, animal testing and clinical trials are major elements of \\"in vivo\\" research. \\"In vivo\\" testing is often employed over \\"in vitro\\" because it is better suited for observing the overall effects of an experiment on a living subject. In drug discovery, for example, verification of efficacy \\"in vivo\\" is crucial, because \\"in vitro\\" assays can sometimes yield misleading results with drug candidate molecules that are irrelevant \\"in vivo\\" (e.g., because such molecules cannot reach their site of \\"in vivo\\" action, for example as a result of rapid catabolism in the liver).\\n\\n- An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements.\\n\\n- Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.\\n\\n- In cell biology, the cytoplasm is the material within a living cell, excluding the cell nucleus. It comprises cytosol (the gel-like substance enclosed within the cell membrane) and the organelles  the cell's internal sub-structures. All of the contents of the cells of prokaryote organisms (such as bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus) are contained within the cytoplasm. Within the cells of eukaryote organisms the contents of the cell nucleus are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the nucleoplasm. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless.\\n\\n- Metabolic wastes or excretes are substances left over from metabolic processes (such as cellular respiration), which cannot be used by the organism (they are surplus or toxic), and must therefore be excreted. This includes nitrogen compounds, water, CO, phosphates, sulfates, etc. Animals treat these compounds as excretes. Plants have chemical \\"machinery\\" which transforms some of them (primarily the nitrogen compounds) into useful substances, and it has been shown by Brian J. Ford that abscissa leaves also carry wastes away from the parent plant. In this way, Ford argues that the shed leaf acts as an \\"excretory\\" (an organ carrying away excretory products).\\n\\n- Lysis (; Greek  \\"lýsis\\", \\"a losing\\" from  \\"lýein\\", \\"to unbind\\") refers to the breaking down of the membrane of a cell, often by viral, enzymic, or osmotic (that is, \\"lytic\\" ) mechanisms that compromise its integrity. A fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a \\"lysate\\". In molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology laboratories, cell cultures may be subjected to lysis in the process of purifying their components, as in protein purification, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, or in purifying organelles.\\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Blood plasma is a straw colored liquid component of blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension; this makes plasma the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume. It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside of cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (68%) (i.e.serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg, HCO, Cl, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and oxygen.\\nPlasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolytes in balanced form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.\\n\\n- In Vitroes are a fictional genetically engineered subspecies of humans in the science fiction television series \\"\\". The name is etymologically derived from the Latin phrase \\"\\"in vitro\\"\\", which is used in science to refer to state of being in an artificial environment outside the living organism. Thus, In Vitro refers to the race not only being conceived in a laboratory, but also artificially gestated in glass and metal cylinders, to be \\"born\\" as young adults.\\n\\n- Hemolysis or haemolysis, also known by several other names, is the rupturing (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the release of their contents (cytoplasm) into surrounding fluid (e.g. blood plasma). Hemolysis may occur in vivo or in vitro (inside or outside the body).\\n\\n- The liver is a vital organ of vertebrates and some other animals. In the human, it is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. The liver has a wide range of functions, including detoxification of various metabolites, protein synthesis, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion.\\n\\n- The circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system, is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases, stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain homeostasis. The study of the blood flow is called hemodynamics. The study of the properties of the blood flow is called hemorheology.\\n\\n- Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. \\n\\n- A misnomer is a word or term that suggests a meaning that is known to be wrong. Misnomers often arise because the thing received its name long before its true nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. \\"Misnomer\\" does not mean \\"misunderstanding\\" or \\"popular misconception\\", and many misnomers remain in legitimate use (that is, being a misnomer does not always make a name incorrect).\\n\\n- Red blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's principal means of delivering oxygen (O) to the body tissuesvia blood flow through the circulatory system. RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs, or gills of fish, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.\\n\\n- Hemotoxins , haemotoxins or hematotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells ( that is , cause hemolysis ) , disrupt blood clotting , and / or cause organ degeneration and generalized tissue damage . The term hemotoxin is to some degree a misnomer since toxins that damage the blood also damage other tissues . Injury from a hemotoxic agent is often very painful and can cause permanent damage and in severe cases death . Loss of an affected limb is possible even with prompt treatment . Hemotoxins are frequently employed by venomous animals , including vipers and pit vipers . Animal venoms contain enzymes and other proteins that are hemotoxic or neurotoxic or occasionally both ( as in the Mojave Rattlesnake , the Japanese mamushi , and similar species ) . In addition to killing the prey , part of the function of a hemotoxic venom for some animals is to aid digestion . The venom breaks down protein in the region of the bite , making prey easier to digest . The process by which a hemotoxin causes death is much slower than that of a neurotoxin . Snakes which envenomate a prey animal may have to track the prey as it flees . Typically , a mammalian prey item will stop fleeing not because of death , but due to shock caused by the venomous bite . Symptoms are dependent upon species , size , location of bite and the amount of venom injected . In humans , symptoms include nausea , disorientation , and headache ; these may be delayed for several hours . Hemotoxins are used in diagnostic studies of the coagulation system . Lupus anticoagulans is detected by changes in the dilute Russell 's viper venom time ( DRVVT ) , which is a laboratory assay based on -- as its name indicates -- venom of the Russell 's viper .\\n\\n- A nutrient is a component in foods that an organism uses to survive and grow. Macronutrients provide the bulk energy an organism's metabolic system needs to function while micronutrients provide the necessary cofactors for metabolism to be carried out. Both types of nutrients can be acquired from the environment. Micronutrients are used to build and repair tissues and to regulate body processes while macronutrients are converted to, and used for, energy. Methods of nutrient intake are different for plants and animals. Plants take in nutrients directly from the soil through their roots and from the atmosphere through their leaves.

In this study, we analyzed the equilibrium binding of streptavidin-based pMHC oligomers (tetramers) and their dissociation kinetics from CD8(pos) T cells from 2C-TCR transgenic mice and from T cell hybridomas that expressed the 2C TCR or a high-affinity mutant (m33) of this TCR. Our results show that the tetramers did not come close to saturating cell-surface TCR (binding only 10-30% of cell-surface receptors), as is generally assumed in deriving affinity values (K(D)), in part because of dissociative losses from tetramer-stained cells. Guided by a kinetic model, the oligomer dissociation rate and equilibrium constants were seen to depend not only on monovalent association and dissociation rates (k(off) and k(on)), but also on a multivalent association rate (μ) and TCR cell-surface density.

He grew up in the South and was steeped in its history. His birthplace was less than a hundred miles from the site of Nat Turner's slave rebellion, later the source for Styron's most famous and controversial novel.  Although Styron's paternal grandparents had been slave owners, his Northern mother and liberal Southern father gave him a broad perspective on race relations. Styron's childhood was a difficult one. His father, a shipyard engineer, suffered from clinical depression, which Styron himself would later experience. His mother died from breast cancer in 1939 when Styron was still a boy, following her decade-long battle with the disease.  Styron attended public school in Warwick County, first at Hilton School and then at Morrison High School (now known as Warwick High School) for two years, until his father sent him to Christchurch School, an Episcopal college-preparatory school in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Styron once said, \\"But of all the schools I attended...only Christchurch ever commanded something more than mere respect--which is to say, my true and abiding affection.\\"  Upon graduation, Styron enrolled in Davidson College and joined Phi Delta Theta. By the age of eighteen he was reading the writers who would have a lasting influence on his vocation as a novelist and writer, especially Thomas Wolfe. Styron transferred to Duke University in 1943 as a part of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps V-12 program aimed at fast-tracking officer candidates by enrolling them simultaneously in basic training and bachelor's degree programs. There he published his first fiction, a short story heavily influenced by William Faulkner, in an anthology of student work.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

We have matched this state of chronic, subacute 'inflammation' by low-level activation of NF-kappaB in the liver of transgenic mice, designated LIKK, by selectively expressing constitutively active IKK-b in hepatocytes. These mice exhibit a type 2 diabetes phenotype, characterized by hyperglycemia, profound hepatic insulin resistance, and moderate systemic insulin resistance, including effects in muscle. The hepatic production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, was increased in LIKK mice to a similar extent as induced by HFD in in wild-type mice. Parallel increases were observed in cytokine signaling in liver and mucscle of LIKK mice. Insulin resistance was improved by systemic neutralization of IL-6 or salicylate inhibition of IKK-beta. Hepatic expression of the IkappaBalpha superrepressor (LISR) reversed the phenotype of both LIKK mice and wild-type mice fed an HFD. These findings indicate that lipid accumulation in the liver leads to subacute hepatic 'inflammation' through NF-kappaB activation and downstream cytokine production. This causes insulin resistance both locally in liver and systemically..

We also studied the accuracy of transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) in estimating arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We compared pulse oximeter SaO2 with simultaneously measured SaO2 (range 78% to 100%) using a co-oximeter. Over a wide range of values for heart rate, blood pressure, hematocrit, PO2, PCO2, and pH, linear regression analysis revealed a close correlation between in vivo pulse oximeter readings and in vitro SaO2 measurements in patients with acute (r = 0.86, Y = 29.64 + 0.68X) and chronic (r = 0.91, Y = 6.29 + 0.96X) disease. Regression analysis of tcPO2 versus PaO2 showed an r value of 0.76 in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In these patients the mean difference between pulse oximeter SaO2 and in vitro SaO2 was 2.9% +/- 1.8% (SD), whereas the mean difference between tcPO2 and PaO2 was -14.5 +/- 11.1 mm Hg.

Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life.

Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. \\nQuestion: In what year is Orion expected to launch?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia.\\n\\nDiplo was born on November 10, 1978, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. He is of German and English descent. The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape his production style. He spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic Miami bass. He began attending the University of Central Florida in 1997, and then moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at Temple University, where he first garnered attention as a DJ. After frequently running into fellow DJ Low Budget, the two began throwing parties under the Hooked on Hollertronix moniker in 2003 as a way of maintaining control of what they were able to play during DJ gigs in Philadelphia. The success of these parties allowed the two to release mixtapes, both separate and together, gathering acclaim across the country. One such mixtape, Never Scared, was named one of the New York Times top ten albums of 2003, and the Hollertronix name became synonymous with parties featuring guests like Maluca Mala, Bun B, Spank Rock, M.I.A., among others. Hollertronix's sound has been described as \\"disparate genres to be smashed together for maximum attention-grabbing impact\\" an aesthetic which takes from the \\"organic, cohesive, whole\\" aesthetic of acts such as Bun B, Lil Jon, Drama, M.I.A., Bjork, Busta Rhymes, and others.  Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, Florida, which was released on the Ninja Tune imprint, Big Dada Records. The album Florida was pressed twice, first with a CD and the second with a CD and DVD. The DVD was created by System D-128, another artist who has collaborated with Diplo on some audio and video projects. Before Florida's DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called Diplo: \\"Banned in Libya\\" which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called \\"Thingamajawn\\" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the Florida DVD, \\"Banned in Libya\\" is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called baile funk, or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (Favela on Blast, Favela Strikes Back), which served to bring the Brazilian dance music of the ghettos to the United States.  It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built \\"The Mausoleum,\\" a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia. Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, Boys Noize, Nicos Gun, and more.\\n\\nWho were his parents?","target":"Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz.","rationale":"The context states that Diplo was born to Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. \\nSo, the correct answer is: Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz.\\","},{"source":"Two cousins lived 10,000 miles away from each other but often talked about visiting the Hawaiian islands together.

Such programmes can discern undisclosed private information such as Facebook users' sexuality, drug-use habits and even whether their parents separated when they were young, according to the study by Cambridge university academics. In one of the biggest studies of its kind, scientists from the university's psychometrics team and a Microsoft-funded research centre analysed data from 58,000 Facebook users to predict traits and other information that were not provided in their profiles. The algorithms were 88 per cent accurate in predicting male sexual orientation, 95 per cent for race and 80 per cent for religion and political leanings. Personality types and emotional stability were also predicted with accuracy ranging from 62-75 per cent. Facebook declined to comment. The study highlights growing concerns about social networks and how data trails can be mined for sensitive information, even when people attempt to keep information about themselves private. Less than 5 per cent of users predicted to be gay, for example, were connected with explicitly gay groups. Michal Kosinksi, one of the report's authors, told the Financial Times that the university's techniques could easily be replicated by companies to infer personal attributes a person did not wish to share, such as sexual orientation or political views: \\"We used very simple and generic methods. Marketing companies and internet companies could spend much more time and resources, and hence get much higher accuracy than we did.\\" Last week , the EU agreed to water down proposals for a radical overhaul of data privacy regulation.

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.\\nWar's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov.\\n\\n- Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\".\\n\\n- The Caucasus Mountains are a mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in the Caucasus region.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of .

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\\n\\n- The Sea of Azov (\\"Azovs'ke more/Azovke more\\") is a sea in Eastern Europe. To the south it is linked by the narrow (about ) Strait of Kerch to the Black Sea, and it is sometimes regarded as a northern extension of the Black Sea.

For example, the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the Ukrainian People's Republic on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918. In Estonia, two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Provincial Assembly, established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918. Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in the province, although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.The success of the October Revolution transformed the Russian state into a soviet republic. A coalition of anti-Bolshevik groups attempted to unseat the new government in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922. In an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks' separate peace with the Central Powers, the Allied powers  occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing. The United States did not recognize the new Russian government until 1933.

Passage:The Xianbei (; ) were an ancient nomadic people that once resided in the eastern Eurasian steppes in what is today Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and Northeastern China. They originated from the Donghu people who splintered into the Wuhuan and Xianbei when they were defeated by the Xiongnu at the end of the 3rd century BC. The Xianbei were largely subordinate to larger nomadic powers and the Han dynasty until they gained prominence in 87 AD by killing the Xiongnu chanyu Youliu. However unlike the Xiongnu, the Xianbei political structure lacked the organization to pose a concerted challenge to the Chinese for most of their time as a nomadic people. After suffering several defeats by the end of the Three Kingdoms period, the Xianbei migrated south and settled in close proximity to Chinese society and submitted as vassals, being granted the titles of Dukes. As the Xianbei Murong, Tuoba and Duan tribes were one of the Five Barbarians who were vassals of the Han Chinese Western Jin and Eastern Jin dynasties, they took part in the Uprising of the Five Barbarians as allies of the Han Chinese Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians, the Xiongnu, Jie, Di and Qiang. The Xianbei were at one point all defeated and conquered by the Di Former Qin empire before it fell apart at the Battle of Fei River at the hands of the Eastern Jin. The Xianbei later founded their own states and reunited northern China as the Northern Wei.

The franchise was nicknamed the Cubs by the Chicago Daily News in 1902, although not officially becoming the Chicago Cubs until the 1907 season. During this period, which has become known as baseball's dead-ball era, Cub infielders Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance were made famous as a double-play combination by Franklin P. Adams' poem Baseball's Sad Lexicon. The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the New York Evening Mail. Mordecai \\"Three-Finger\\" Brown, Jack Taylor, Ed Reulbach, Jack Pfiester, and Orval Overall were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the \\"Hitless Wonders\\" White Sox in the 1906 World Series, the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best winning percentage (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice.

Research in the sixties found the opposite. Bilingual people scored higher than monolinguals, people who speak only one language. So which is it?\\nResearchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystok says it probably does make you better at certain skills.\\nEllen Bialystok said, \\"Imagine driving down the highway. There're many things that could\\ncapture your attention and you really need to be able to monitor all of them. Why would bilingualism make you any better at that?\\"\\nAnd the answer, she says, is that bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention -- a function called the executive control system.\\nMs. Bialystok is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The .problem is that the words are all names of color1s.\\nEllen Bialystok said, \\"So you would have the word blue written in red, but you have to say red. But blue is so salient , it's just lighting up all these circuits  in your brain, and you really want to say blue. So you need a mechanism  to  _ that so that you can say red. That's the executive control system.\\"\\nHer work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to suppress  one to be able to speak in the other.\\nThis mental exercise might help in other ways, too.

He is considered to be one of the most well known composers in the video game industry. Sometimes referred to as the \\"Beethoven of video games music\\", he appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu, a self-taught musician, began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as his biggest influence.\\n\\nUematsu left Square Enix in 2004 and formed his own production company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure was that the company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo, and he was not comfortable with the new location. Also, he cites the fact that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer, Hamauzu.  Uematsu also works closely with Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker, and has composed for Blue Dragon (2006), Lost Odyssey (2007), Away: Shuffle Dungeon (2008); The Last Story (2011); and Terra Battle (2014). He also wrote music for the cancelled game Cry On.  Uematsu created the main theme for the multi-composer game Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008. He then composed the music for the 2009 anime Guin Saga; this marked the first time he provided a full score for an animated series. Uematsu recently contributed music and storyline to an e-book titled called \\"Blik-0 1946\\". He is currently working on soundtracks for multiple games, including Project Phoenix.  Uematsu appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. In 2012, \\"Aerith's Theme\\", written by Uematsu for Final Fantasy VII, was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM (UK) \\"Hall of Fame\\" top 300 chart. It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart. In 2013, music from the Final Fantasy series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu and his Final Fantasy music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014, number nine in 2015, and number 17 in 2016.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Nobuo Uematsu","rationale":"The context is essentially a biography of Nobuo Uematsu.

Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums.

In the second quarter, the Steelers took the lead with kicker Jeff Reed getting a 22-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast. Vikernes contends that the date June 6 was really picked because the first recorded Viking raid (upon Lindisfarne) occurred, according to Vikernes, on June 6, 793.

Hitchens originally hoped to become a naval officer himself, but an eye defect prevented him from doing so. He was educated at the Leys School and the Oxford College of Further Education before being accepted at the University of York, where he studied Philosophy and Politics and was a member of Alcuin College, graduating in 1973. He later commented that he \\"must have been a severe disappointment\\" to his parents after making sure he \\"would never get into Oxbridge\\" by sabotaging his own education, through actions which included being arrested breaking into a government fall-out shelter in Cambridge.\\n\\nHitchens joined the Conservative Party in 1997, but left in 2003. He challenged Michael Portillo for the Conservative nomination in the Kensington and Chelsea seat in 1999, accusing Portillo of \\"washy moderation\\". However, he says that he had \\"no interest in securing the nomination\\" and \\"no chance\\" of doing so, his real reasons having been to gain book publicity and \\"to draw attention to Michael Portillo's non-conservative politics\\".  Hitchens believes that no party he could support will be created until the Conservative Party disintegrates, an event he first began calling for in 2006. From 2008, he claimed that what would facilitate such a collapse would be for the Conservative Party to lose the 2010 general election. In 2012, Hitchens announced he was once more considering standing as a Member of Parliament and called for British citizens to form \\"small exploratory committees in existing constituencies, under the Justice and Liberty motto\\".  Hitchens mainly comments on political and religious issues, and generally espouses a social conservative viewpoint. He is deeply pessimistic about recent, present and future Britain and sees himself as Britain's obituarist, writing about what he sees as the death of Britain for future historians to look back on. In 2010 Michael Gove, writing in The Times, asserted that, for Hitchens, what is more important than the split between the Left and the Right is \\"the deeper gulf between the restless progressive and the Christian pessimist\\", and in 2010 Hitchens himself wrote \\"in all my experience in life, I have seldom seen a more powerful argument for the fallen nature of man, and his inability to achieve perfection, than those countries in which man sets himself up to replace God with the State.\\"  In 2009, Anthony Howard wrote of Hitchens, \\"the old revolutionary socialist has lost nothing of his passion and indignation as the years have passed us all by.

Dunnottar Castle was the last stronghold to fall to the English Parliament's troops in May 1652. Under the terms of the Tender of Union, the Scots were given 30 seats in a united Parliament in London, with General Monck appointed as the military governor of Scotland. During the Interregnum, Scotland was kept under the military occupation of an English army under George Monck. Sporadic Royalist rebellions continued throughout the Commonwealth period in Scotland, particularly in western Highlands, where Alasdair MacColla had raised his forces in the 1640s. The north west Highlands was the scene of another pro-royalist uprising in 1653-55, which was only put down with deployment of 6,000 English troops there. Monck garrisoned forts all over the Highlands — for example at Inverness, and finally put an end to Royalist resistance when he began deporting prisoners to the West Indies as indentured labourers. However, lawlessness remained a problem, with bandits known as mosstroopers, very often former Royalist or Covenanter soldiers, plundering both the English troops and the civilian population. After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, the factions and divisions which had struggled for supremacy during the early years of the interregnum reemerged. Monck, who had served Cromwell and the English Parliament throughout the civil wars, judged that his best interests and those of his country lay in the Restoration of Charles II. In 1660, he marched his troops south from Scotland to ensure the monarchy's reinstatement. Scotland's Parliament and legislative autonomy were restored under The Restoration though many issues that had led to the wars; religion, Scotland's form of government and the status of the Highlands, remained unresolved. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, many more Scots would die over the same disputes in Jacobite rebellions.\\n\\nWho had raised his forces in the 1640s in western Highlands?","target":"MacColla","rationale":"In the given passage, it is mentioned that Alasdair MacColla had raised his forces in western Highlands in 1640s."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: A text that has been revised and made into a new edition can be called a?\\nContext: Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks and nuns.

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off.

The diagnosis of specific disease processes has allowed for prenatal intervention by new techniques designed to improve fetal survival. The application of ventricular pacing in a hydropic fetus with complete atrioventricular (AV) block is reported. Complete AV block resulted from maternal collagen vascular disease. The application of ventricular pacing was to allow for further in utero development and for reversal of hydrops fetalis after improvement in cardiac output. Despite fetal death 4 hours after placement of the ventricular pacing lead, this procedure when applied earlier in the development of hydrops may allow for fetal survival. Ventricular pacing was accomplished without apparent trauma to mother or fetus and no evidence of fetal injury was seen at necropsy. Therefore, in the fetus who would otherwise die in utero before the point of viability ex utero, fetal ventricular pacing may be a rational alternative to current observation. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cats 3)Laryngeal Nerves","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes the use of ventricular pacing to improve cardiac output and survival in a hydropic fetus with complete atrioventricular block.

Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, while Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases.\\n\\nWhich town has fewer people that caught the flu?\\n\\nHint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria.

They were both pretty active, but Bill loved salty foods and red wine. He got dizzy one day and went to the doctor. Bill had hypertension. Bob, on the other hand was hypotensive.\\n\\nHint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.","target":"Bill","rationale":"As described in the question's hint, hypertension is said to be present when a person has either an elevated systolic blood pressure (140 or higher) or diastolic blood pressure (90 or higher).\\nIn this case, Bill goes to the doctor because he had dizziness.

After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium.

The city government attached a banner reading \\"Paris defends human rights throughout the world\\" to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values \\"of all humanity and of human rights.\\" Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests.

Despite the success of these drugs, their efficacy is limited in patients whose tumors demonstrate de novo or acquired resistance to treatment. The β1 integrin resides on the membrane of the breast cancer cell, activating several elements of breast tumor progression including proliferation and survival.   \\n METHODS We developed a panel of HER2-overexpressing cell lines resistant to L, T, and the potent LT combination through long-term exposure and validated these models in 3D culture. Parental and L/T/LT-resistant cells were subject to HER2 and β1 integrin inhibitors in 3D and monitored for 12 days, followed by quantification of colony number. Parallel experiments were conducted where cells were either stained for Ki-67 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) or harvested for protein and analyzed by immunoblot. Results were subjected to statistical testing using analysis of variance and linear contrasts, followed by adjustment with the Sidak method.   \\n RESULTS Using multiple cell lines including BT474 and HCC1954, we reveal that in L and LT resistance, where phosphorylation of EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER3 are strongly inhibited, kinases downstream of β1 integrin--including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src--are up-regulated. Blockade of β1 by the antibody AIIB2 abrogates this up-regulation and functionally achieves significant growth inhibition of L and LT resistant cells in 3D, without dramatically affecting the parental cells. SiRNA against β1 as well as pharmacologic inhibition of FAK achieve the same growth inhibitory effect.

From June 1906, an agreement between the former rebels of Theriso and the Cretan Assembly allowed for the creation of a constituent assembly led by Antonios Michelidakis. On 2 December, this body submitted a new constitution to Zaimis, who then swore allegiance to it. Order gradually returned to the island. A public administration was set up and laws passed for improving the health and education systems. In July 1907, Michelidakis was elected president of the Cretan Assembly, defeating Konstantinos Foumis by 34 to 31 votes. Impressed by the efforts the Cretan government had made, and having received assurances regarding the safety of the Muslim population, the European powers decided to send their troops home.

K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. First mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" the Ministry makes its first proper appearance in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\". Throughout the books, it is generally depicted as either corrupt, incompetent, or both, with its high officials blind to actual events and dangers. It reaches a nadir of corruption before being effectively taken over by Lord Voldemort. At the end of the final book, following Voldemort's death, Kingsley Shacklebolt takes over the ministry, changing it for the better. By the time of \\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\\", Hermione Granger is the Minister for Magic.\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters and the Power of Love , or Power of Love , is the third studio album by indie rock band Harry and the Potters , released on July 4 , 2006 . The album was primarily inspired by the sixth novel in the Harry Potter book series .\\n\\n- Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.\\n\\n- Lord Voldemort (or in the films) (born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character and the central antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of \\"Harry Potter\\" novels. Voldemort first appeared in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\", which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", where he is only mentioned.\\n\\n- A story arc is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a narrative arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.\\n\\n- Ronald Bilius \\"Ron\\" Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family, who reside in \\"The Burrow\\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of the Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series.\\n\\n- In the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series, a Muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family. Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood in them. It differs from the term \\"Squib\\", which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power/ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive term \\"mudblood\\"), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. The equivalent term used by the in-universe magic community of America is No-Maj.\\n\\n- Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. \\n\\n- Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles.\\n\\n- Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.\\n\\n- Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters are an American rock band known for spawning the genre of wizard rock. Founded in Norwood, Massachusetts in 2002, the group is primarily composed of brothers Joe and Paul DeGeorge, who both perform under the persona of the title character from the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series. Harry and the Potters are known for their elaborate live performances, and have developed a cult following within the \\"Harry Potter\\" fandom.\\n\\n- A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.\\n\\n- Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.\\n\\n- Joanne \\"Jo\\" Rowling, (born 31 July 1965), pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist, screenwriter and film producer best known as the author of the \\"Harry Potter\\" fantasy series. The books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies. They have become the best-selling book series in history and been the basis for a series of films over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Wizard rock (sometimes shortened as Wrock) is a genre of rock music that developed between 2002 and 2004 in the United States. Wizard rock bands are characterized by their performances and humorous songs about the \\"Harry Potter\\" universe. Wizard rock initially started in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.","target":"harry and the potters and the power of love , wizard rock","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"harry and the potters and the power of love , wizard rock\\"."},{"source":"Question: Where can you buy shampoo along side items for nourishment?\\n\\nChoices: \\n- hair salon\\n- cabinet\\n- supermarket\\n- big box stores\\n- at hotel\\n\\nThe rationale to choose \\"supermarket\\" as the answer is that:","target":"supermarket home | facebook","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"supermarket home | facebook\\"."},{"source":"I am hesitating between 4 options to answer the following question, which option should I choose?\\nQuestion: Puddles on a sidewalk are evaporating quickly.

On 14 September 1914 Major Geoffrey Salmond , CO of No.3 Sqdn and Captain Donald Swain Lewis carried out a successful experiment with a Royal artillery battery using a radio transmitter to communicate the fall of artillery shells . Lewis is also credited with creating the \`\` grid square '' map system which revolutionized British wartime cartography . This was probably not an Ordnance Survey style grid based on a system of mile or kilometre squaring , but a system based on squares identified by letters and numbers . In the Battle of the Aisne ( September -- October 1914 ) , Lewis squared two copies of a 1:80,000 map , keeping one copy for himself for observing from the air , and giving a second copy to a battery commander with whom he was in wireless communication . On 15 September the British Third Corps assigned its RFC squadrons to support the divisional heavy & howitzer batteries . The radio - equipped aeroplanes successfully supported the artillery in taking out German positions during the offensive on the Aisne .

During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.\\n\\n- The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.\\n\\n- The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world.

A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'.

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.\\nAlthough Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist/bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt.\\nContext: Following the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits, ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.  Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song \\"Angel of Death\\" which detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.  In October 1986, Slayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: \\"I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.\\" To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" for the film Less Than Zero. Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it \\"a poor representation of Slayer\\" and King labeling it \\"a hunk of shit,\\" it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.\\nQuestion: What were some of the songs on the album?.

His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope.\\n\\nHint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.","target":"December 27, 2020","rationale":"After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system.

With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.\\n\\nWhat new theory states that traumatic events during adolescence have lifelong effects?","target":"epistemological trauma theory","rationale":"The passage mentions the epistemological trauma theory which posits that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior. \\nTherefore, this is a good question to ask based on the given context."},{"source":"Decide the language of that sentence.

It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on.

Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes.\\n\\nA pharmaceutical company is trying to find the cure for allergy. To that end, they conducted an experiment with two groups of subjects, group A and group B.

He has also been involved in a number of accident investigations conducted by the USAF and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), such as Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 and USAir Flight 1493. He served as an instructor, Air Line Pilots Association Local Air Safety Chairman, accident investigator, and national technical committee member. His safety work for ALPA led to the development of a Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular. He was instrumental in developing and implementing the Crew Resource Management course that is used by US Airways, and he has taught the course to hundreds of airline crew members.  Working with NASA scientists, he coauthored a paper on error-inducing contexts in aviation. He was an air accident investigator for an NTSB inquiry into a major accident at Los Angeles International Airport, which \\"led to improved airline procedures and training for emergency evacuations of aircraft\\". Sullenberger has also been studying the psychology behind keeping an airline crew functioning during a crisis.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

Polychaetes' fossil record consists mainly of the jaws that some species had and the mineralized tubes that some secreted. Some Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia in some ways resemble polychaetes, but the similarities are too vague for these fossils to be classified with confidence. The small shelly fossil Cloudina, from 549 to 542 million years ago, has been classified by some authors as an annelid, but by others as a cnidarian (i.e. in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong). Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta, both from Canada's Burgess Shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian. Myoscolex, found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale, was possibly an annelid. However, it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla. Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet, about 518 million years old, and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date. There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid. Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician, about 488 to 474 million years ago. It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found, thus the crown-group cannot have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later. By the end of the Carboniferous, about 299 million years ago, fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared. Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes  , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic, less than 199 million years ago.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"shelly","rationale":"The excerpt mentions the fossil Cloudina, which is known to have a shelly exterior.

Do you look at your glass and see it as half full? Do you believe that every cloud has a silver lining and that things generally turn out for the best? Do you believe that if something is meant to be, it will be? If you reply \\"yes\\" to all of these questions, then you are an optimist. You probably are enthusiastic, cheerful and outgoing. You may be successful at work and in love.\\nBut you may be misguided because things don't turn out for the best. You may believe that when one door closes another one opens (for example, you may fail to obtain a new job; another chance will come around soon). Wrong. When one door closes, another door slams   in your face. That's bitter reality.\\nNow a book has been published which confirms what pessimists   have suspected all along. It's called The Positive Power of Defensive Pessimism. Its author argues that defensive pessimism can lead to positive results. Defensive pessimism is a strategy used to manage fear, anxiety and worry. Defensive pessimists prepare for the things by setting low outcomes for themselves. They carefully consider everything that may go wrong and plan for ways to handle these problems. And this gives them a sense of control. Lawrence Sanno, a psychology professor, says, \\"What's interesting about defensive pessimists is that they tend to be very successful people, so their low opinion of the situation's outcomes is not realistic. They use it to motivate themselves to perform better.\\"\\nSo far, so good. _ . Defensive pessimists prepare carefully and consider what might go wrong, whether at work, on date or even in a sports game. It makes sense to have a back-up plan. There are many sayings in English urging caution. For example, \\"Don't put all your eggs in one basket.\\" And \\"Don't count your chickens until they hatch.\\" To have a confident and optimistic approach to life's problems is good. But listen to what Woody Alien, the American comedian says, \\"Confidence is what you have before you understand the problem.\\"\\nThere are pros and cons to...\\nQuestion: Which of the following English expressions would a defensive pessimist believe?\\nOptions: A: Don't put all your eggs in one basket.\\nB: The glass is half full not half empty.\\nC: Whatever will be, will be.\\nD: Every cloud has a silver lining.","target":"A","rationale":"The article discusses the unfavorable outcomes of being optimistic and emphasizes that defensive pessimists are successful. To be a defensive pessimist, one needs to prepare for all possible scenarios in which something may go wrong. This is similar to \\"not putting all your eggs in one basket\\", because it means having back-up plans instead of relying on just one plan or solution. So among the given options, A is most likely what a defensive pessimist would believe."},{"source":"I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Barb and Dee studied chemistry for a school project.

He has three younger brothers, Daniel, William, and Stephen, who also became actors. He also has two sisters, Beth and Jane. Alec and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics.\\n\\nBaldwin made his Broadway debut in 1986 in a revival of Joe Orton's Loot alongside Zoe Wanamaker, Zeljko Ivanek, Joseph Maher, and Charles Keating. This production closed after three months. His other Broadway credits include Caryl Churchill's Serious Money with Kate Nelligan and a revival of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, for which his performance as Stanley Kowalski garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. Baldwin also received an Emmy nomination for the 1995 television version of the production, in which both he and Jessica Lange reprised their roles, alongside John Goodman and Diane Lane. In 1998, Baldwin played the title role in Macbeth at The Public Theater alongside Angela Bassett and Liev Schreiber in a production directed by George C. Wolfe. In 2004, Baldwin starred in a revival of Broadway's Twentieth Century about a successful and egomaniacal Broadway director (Baldwin), who has transformed a chorus girl (Anne Heche) into a leading lady.  On June 9, 2005, he appeared in a concert version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific at Carnegie Hall. He starred as Luther Billis, alongside Reba McEntire as Nellie and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile. The production was taped and telecast by PBS on April 26, 2006. In 2006, Baldwin made theater news in Roundabout Theatre Company's Off-Broadway revival of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr. Sloane. In 2010, Baldwin starred opposite Sam Underwood in a critically acclaimed revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus, directed by Tony Walton at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York.

Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (\\"maiden\\" in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, \\"maiden\\"-like modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (\\"wand\\") due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus. Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet \\"The Swan of Mantua\\".[citation needed]","target":"Vergil","rationale":"The context explains that the German spelling of Virgil is Vergilius.

In Tahitian mythology, Oviri was the goddess of mourning. She is shown with long pale hair, and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet, while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a \\"civilised savage\\". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a \\"master of animals\\" type, and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java.\\nGauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed stoneware, and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the Musée d'Orsay.  His sales of the casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked for one to be placed on his grave. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: he described the figure as a strange and cruel enigma on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of Oviri for Stéphane Mallarmé; he referred to it as La Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\") in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard; and he appended an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta in a c. 1899 drawing.

Aliens are currently studying the two planets to see if either of them are suitable for habitation. While studying the planets, they discover that both planets have the same type of atmosphere. However, there is one key difference. The difference is that the current species of animals on Blimpton emit much more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's animals do. The aliens take note of this so they can report back to their bosses on what they have found.\\n\\nHint: There is a large area of low ozone concentration or \\"ozone hole\\" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.","target":"Jarmel","rationale":"Chlorofluorocarbons are molecules that contain chlorine, fluorine and carbon. These chemicals have been used as refrigerants in air conditioners and aerosols like hairspray. When they reach the stratosphere, they break down ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2). Ozone has a lower boiling point than regular Oxygen so some of it evaporates to form O2 gas which is lighter than the rest of the atmosphere. This leaves a hole or low concentration area that allows more UV light to penetrate through unobstructed by any gases because there isn't enough ozone left to absorb them all anymore. The effect on Antarctica's climate due to lessened amounts of this compound leads us back towards Jarmel being warmer since its animals emit much less CFCs"},{"source":"Tokio Myers -- Torville Jones (born 6 April 1984), better known by his stage name Tokio Myers, is a pianist and music producer born in London.

In non-primate mammals, retinal fibres of this system project to a set of three nuclei: the dorsal (DTN), the lateral (LTN) and the medial (MTN) terminal nuclei. Whereas all AOS cells respond to the slow motion of large visual stimuli, the neurons are tuned to complementary directions of movement: horizontal temporo-nasal direction for the DTN, vertical up and down for the LTN and vertical down for the MTN. It has thus been suggested that these nuclei establish a system of retinal coordinates for the detection of whole field motion. As the AOS provides direct and indirect pathways to both oculomotor and vestibular structures, each of these nuclei is thought to be an essential link in the co-ordination of eye and head movements in relation to movement within the visual-field. One problem for the generalization of this theory is that the medial terminal nucleus has never been found in primates. In this report we establish both the existence of this nucleus and its afferent input from the retina in all major groups of primates (prosimians, New and Old World monkeys and apes), indicating a common anatomical plan of organization of the AOS in mammals. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: A common mammalian plan of accessory optic system organization revealed in all primates. option2: Ferrite particles: a superparamagnetic MR contrast agent for enhanced detection of liver carcinoma.","target":"A common mammalian plan of accessory optic system organization revealed in all primates","rationale":"The title should be an accurate description of what is addressed in the abstract.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months.

They will make you comfortable while they are around. You feel at ease while talking to them. How is it done? Here are several skills that good talkers have. If you follow the skills, they'll help people feel relaxed and make friends with them quickly.\\nFirst of all, good talkers ask questions. Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \\"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning. It's a common question, but it will get things going.\\" From there you can move on to other matters--sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go.\\nSecond, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen to the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your questions should have a point and help to tell what kind of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the topic of conversation. If someone insists on one topic, it means he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the voice. If the voice sounds bored, then, it's time for you to change the topic.\\nFinally, good talkers know well how to deal with the moment of saying good-bye. If you're saying it, you may give him a handshake and say, \\"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret. Let people know your thoughts.\\nAfter asking somebody a question, it'll be polite of you to    _   .\\nA) agree with what others say all the time\\nB) listen to his reply attentively\\nC) wait impatiently for his answer\\nD) go on asking him more questions","target":"B","rationale":"After asking somebody a question, it'll be polite of you to    B  .\\nB) listen to his reply attentively."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence from the research paper and your task is to classify the given sentence into the following categories: Background (Why is this problem important?

Passage 1:The original catalyst for development was the ill-fated vanity project by Lord Kensington (died 1852) which consisted of the two-mile conversion of the insanitary Counter's Creek into the Kensington Canal (1826 onwards), followed by its eventual replacement first by \\"Mr Punch's railway\\", opened in 1844 and next, by the Metropolitan District Railway in 1865–69, which eventually became London Underground's District Line and was joined after 1907 by the Piccadilly line. Meanwhile, the congestion apparent in London and Middlesex for burials at the start of the century was causing public concern not least on health grounds. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground on the edge of Earl's Court in an outlying area of Brompton. The moving spirit behind the project was the engineer, Stephen Geary. It was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the proposal. Securing the land – some 40 acres – from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. After two years the cemetery was duly established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It was consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London in June 1840, and is now one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries, served by the adjacent West Brompton station.\\n Passage 2:Bonko first sought political office in the 1995 municipal election, when he was elected to the Board of Edmonton Public Schools as trustee for Ward A.

It is important to keep in mind that detox is just the initial step on the long road of recovery. Detox marks the abrupt ending of alcohol intake and is necessary for the body to cleanse itself of all traces of alcohol. The detox process usually takes seven to 10 days. Rehab programs, however, usually last a minimum of 30 to 45 days. Some clients benefit from 60- or 90-day stays at residential or inpatient treatment centers. If you or somebody you love is struggling with alcohol abuse, we are here to help. 1  New NIAAA resource gives guidance on treatment options for alcohol problems. 2  Heilig M, Egli M, Crabbe JC, Becker HC. 3  Alcohol’s Effects on the Body. 4  Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms + How Long Do They Last? 5  Spear SE. The length of stay is based on the following: 1  The specific addiction. 2  Addiction history. 3  Addiction severity. 4  The presence of other medical, mental or behavioral health conditions (co-occurring diagnosis) 5  The client’s physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual needs. 3 The Short-Term Detox is the Most Popular, But Often the Least Successful. Short-term detox programs can include 24-hour juice fasting, chelation therapy (a toxicology treatment for removing heavy metals from the system), colon cleansing (commonly known as colonics), skin cleansing, and intravenous injections. Before starting at-home detox treatments, Beljanski recommends that those looking to seriously detox and improve their overall health and wellness receive a medical consultation for their detox needs first so they can truly discover the root of their symptoms and receive the best treatment regime. It is important to keep in mind that detox is just the initial step on the long road of recovery. Detox marks the abrupt ending of alcohol intake and is necessary for the body to cleanse itself of all traces of alcohol. The detox process usually takes  seven to 10 days. Rehab programs, however, usually last a minimum of 30 to 45 days. 8 Your Body Is Already Designed to Naturally Detox Itself. The most important thing to keep in mind about healthy detoxing, says Mangieri, is that it's not necessary to go on a special diet to 'clean' your digestive track; that is the role of our organs.. These natural salts are also said to help cleanse your colon when added to water. While epsom salt baths can be a natural way to soothe the body and aid with muscle relaxation, there's no conclusive evidence that it actually helps you slim down or flush away toxins. The Long-Term Effects of Alcohol on the Body. Long-term addiction can take a heavy toll on the entire body. Alcohol can impact the heart and cause cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias (Irregular heart beat), stroke and high blood pressure. The liver takes the brunt with repercussions including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. If there are no co-occurring conditions or other drug use or treatment, alcohol withdrawal follows a characteristic course consisting of three relatively distinct phases.2 The phases are as follows: 1  Acute withdrawal: This period is dominated by tremors, autonomic nervous system hyperactivity and the risk for DTs and seizures.

Glittertind ( official form on maps : Glittertinden ) is the second highest mountain in Norway , at 2,465 m above sea level , including the glacier at its peak ( without the glacier , it is 2452 m ) . It is located within the municipality of Lom , in the Jotunheimen mountain area . Glittertind had earlier been a challenger for the title as the highest mountain in Norway , as measurements showed Glittertind including the glacier was slightly higher than Galdhøpiggen ( 2,469 m above sea level ) . The glacier has , however , shrunk in recent years , and the dispute has been settled in Galdhøpiggen 's favour . The summit of Glittertind was reached for the first time in 1841 by Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland and Hans Sletten . Glittertind is easily accessible from Spiterstulen lodge in the west , by a climb of 1300 m. and from Glitterheim lodge in the east , by a climb of 1000 m. The hike from Glitterheim is the easier , but Glitterheim is inside the National Park and can therefore only be reached by foot . The summit hike is a very popular one , only surpassed in seasonal numbers by Galdhøpiggen , its western neighbor . The route across the glacier that crowns the summit is completely without crevasses , but on a hot summer day it might be a wet hike across the melting snow which covers the ice . Visitors might even experience that the meltwater blows up across the summit , leaving hikers totally soaked . The view is magnificent . East and southeast of Glittertind there are hardly any high peaks , and hence most of the northern and eastern parts of the province of Oppland can be seen . All famous photos of Glittertind are taken on the eastern flank slightly below the top . There used to be a cabin at the summit , but because of the impossibility of mooring it sufficiently , it was taken by a storm and landed on the Grjotbreen glacier , under the steep north wall of the summit .\\n\\n- Galdhøpiggen is the highest mountain in Norway, Scandinavia and Northern Europe, at 2,469 m (8,100 ft) above sea level.

Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas.\\nFrancisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible.

In Italy, the term simply denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin. In English-speaking countries, however, the term \\"giallo\\" is used to refer to a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery film which often includes elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre). The genre began in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades (although some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\\n\\n- Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.\\n\\n- Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature.\\nIn the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.\\n\\n- Eva Bartok (18 June 19271 August 1998), was an actress born in Budapest, Hungary as Éva Márta Szke Ivanovics.

Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), addresses them, informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald), a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.

He was the third actor of this name in a family of actors and managers, and one of the most famous of all 19th century American comedians. Jefferson was particularly well known for his adaptation and portrayal of Rip Van Winkle on the stage, reprising the role in several silent film adaptations. Through his appearances in the latter, he is believed to be the earliest born actor to appear in a film.\\n\\n- Our American Cousin is a three-act play by English playwright Tom Taylor. The play is a farce whose plot is based on the introduction of an awkward, boorish, but honest American, Asa Trenchard, to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play first premiered at Laura Keene's Theatre in New York City on October 15, 1858, and the title character was first played by Joseph Jefferson. Although the play achieved great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century, it is best remembered as the play U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was attending in Ford's Theatre when he was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865.\\n\\n- Ford's Theatre is a theatre in Washington, D.C., used for various stage performances beginning in the 1860s.

Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, \\"de jure\\" slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is \\"de facto\\" forced to work against his or her will.

The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.

Greg remarks that for too long the ozone layer has been a hindrance to progress and that scientists need to work to eliminate it. Mark scoffs at his opponent and says that the only real way to make progress is to make the ozone layer even stronger, not hurt it.\\n\\nWhose proposal will allow more ultraviolet light through the atmosphere?\\n\\nHint: Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.","target":"Greg","rationale":"The ozone layer is an important component of the atmosphere that helps shield life from ultraviolet light.

In 1911, the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du \\"Cubisme\\" in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris). Clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie. It mirrored the attitudes of the \\"artists of Passy\\", which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication. The concept developed in Du \\"Cubisme\\" of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.;\\nQuestion: What year did the term Cubism become used more?;\\nIf you can't find the answer, please respond \\"unanswerable\\".\\nAnswer:","target":"1911","rationale":"The answer to the given question is 1911.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed by the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences.\\nBizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the \\"Habanera\\" from act 1 and the \\"Toreador Song\\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\\nThe opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.\\nAfter the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.\\nThe music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters....","target":"Georges","rationale":"The article says that \\"Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware... .\\" This is a key point in understanding where to look for the answer.

He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. \\nThe only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject.\\nIn 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day.\\nFrom his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End.

The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important offensive skills, are represented. An OPS of .900 or higher in Major League Baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters. Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark.\\n\\n- Comerica Park is an open-air ballpark located in Downtown Detroit. It serves as the home of the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball, replacing Tiger Stadium in 2000.\\n\\n- In baseball, fielder's choice (abbreviated FC) is a term used to refer to a variety of plays involving an offensive player reaching a base due to the defense's attempt to put out another baserunner, or the defensive team's indifference to his advance. Fielder's choice is not called by the umpires on the field of play; rather, it is recorded by the official scorer to account for the offensive player's advance without crediting him with an offensive statistic such as a hit or stolen base.\\n\\n- Joseph Alexander Sargent ( September 24 , 1893 -- July 5 , 1950 ) , nicknamed \`\` Horse Belly , '' was a utility infielder in Major League Baseball playing for the Detroit Tigers in 1921 .

I asked if she expected the facials to be free, and she gave me a dirty look and said of course. Now I'm thinking that not only with this be costly for me, but I'm not going to have a lot of free time as I'm planning to be in school full time, as well as working as many hours as I can without taking away from my school.

My mom is displeased with the class I want to take, and has been persuading me to take an eyelash extension class and a microblading class(where they basically tattoo you're eyebrows on if you have thin eyebrows). Ive told her I don't want to take the eyelash extension class, because there are already plenty of people in my area who do it, and I don't feel comfortable doing a permanent thing such as tattooing eyebrows on someones face. Yesterday she straight up said to me that she wants me to take those classes so I can do her eyelashes and microblade her eyebrows. The class for microblading is over $2000, and I feel like she is being selfish in expecting me to not only do very costly services on her, but take classes Im not interested in doing or paying for, just so I can be her personal esthetician. \\n\\nLike I said before, I have no problem with waxing and tinting her brows, and every once in a while do a skin care treatment, like as a present or for a special occasion.

MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising.

The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.\\n\\n- Leif Edling (born 6 August 1963) is a Swedish musician, best known as the main songwriter, bass player and one of the founding members of the Swedish doom metal band Candlemass. He's the only constant member of the band since its inception to the present day. Nevertheless, since band's second reunion in 2002 Edling has been backed up again by founding rhythm guitarist Mats Björkman, who had been absent from 1997 to 2002 and was replaced by Michael Amott.\\n\\n- The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.\\n\\n- Michael Amott (born 28 July 1970) is a Swedish guitarist, songwriter, founding member of the bands Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars, and Carnage, as well as a former member of the grindcore band Carcass. He is the older brother of Christopher Amott. Some major influences in his music have been Tony Iommi, Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth and Dave Mustaine.\\n\\n- During the 6th millennium BC, agriculture spread from the Balkans to Italy and Eastern Europe, and also from Mesopotamia to Egypt. World population was essentially stable at numbers ranging between approximately 5 and 7 million.\\n\\n- Stockholm County (\\"Stockholms län\\") is a county or \\"län\\" (in Swedish) on the Baltic sea coast of Sweden. It borders Uppsala County and Södermanland County. It also borders Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The city of Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Stockholm County is divided by the historic provinces of Uppland (Roslagen) and Södermanland (Södertörn). More than one fifth of the Swedish population lives in the county. Stockholm County is also one of the statistical \\"riksområden\\" (national areas) according to , Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics within the EU. With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden.\\n\\n- The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make implements with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 3.4 million years, and ended between 8700 BCE and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.\\n\\n- The double bass or simply the bass (and numerous other names) is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. It is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than sounding to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E, A, D and G. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family.\\n\\n- Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.\\n\\n- The sousaphone is a type of tuba designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching. It is widely employed in marching bands and various other musical genres. Designed to fit around the body of the musician and supported by the left shoulder, the sousaphone may be readily played while being carried. It is useful in all types of bands that play outdoors, as it directs the sound forward, unlike a traditional upright tuba. The instrument is named after American bandmaster and composer John Philip Sousa, who popularized its use in his band.\\n\\n- Jan-Håkan \\"Ian\\" Haugland (born 13 August 1964 in Nordreisa, Norway) is the drummer in the Swedish rock band Europe. When he was eight months old, he and his family moved to the Stockholm suburb of Märsta, Sweden. He joined Europe in the summer of 1984, replacing Tony Reno. Previously Haugland had played in a number of bands, including Trilogy, where Candlemass bassist Leif Edling sang, and Yngwie J. Malmsteen's band Rising Force.\\n\\n- A drum kitalso called a drum set, trap set, or simply drumsis a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones most significantly cymbals but also including the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1). In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53) and both hybrid and entirely electronic kits are used.\\nA standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains:\\n\\n- A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.\\n\\n- An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.\\n\\n- Marching percussion instruments are specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a \\"clean\\" sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.\\n\\n- Mälaren, historically referred to as Lake Malar in English, is the third-largest freshwater lake in Sweden (after Vänern and Vättern). Its area is 1,140 km² and its greatest depth is 64 m. Mälaren spans 120 kilometers from east to west. The lake drains, from south-west to north-east, into the Baltic Sea through the Södertälje Canal, Hammarbyslussen, Karl Johansslussen and Norrström. The easternmost bay of Mälaren, in central Stockholm, is called Riddarfjärden. The lake is located in Svealand and bounded by the provinces of Uppland, Södermanland, Närke, and Västmanland. The two largest islands in Mälaren are Selaön (91 km²) and Svartsjölandet (79 km²).\\n\\n- The Stockholm archipelago is the largest archipelago in Sweden, and the second-largest archipelago in the Baltic Sea (the largest being across the Baltic in Finland).\\n\\n- A cymbal is a common percussion instrument. Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: crotales). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist.\\n\\n- The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\\n\\n- Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County.\\n\\n- Keyboard bass (sometimes referred as a synth bass) is the use of a low-pitched keyboard or pedal keyboard to substitute for the bass guitar or double bass in music.\\n\\n- Jan Håkan \`\` Ian '' Haugland ( born 13 August 1964 ) is the drummer in the Swedish rock band Europe . When he was eight months old , he and his family moved to the Swedish suburb Märsta . He joined Europe in the summer of 1984 , replacing Tony Reno .

When he 's not on the road or in the studio , he works as a host on the radio channel 106.7 Rockklassiker in Stockholm and every now and then he plays drums in the studio . As a drummer he endorses Paiste cymbals and Yamaha drums .\\n\\n- Wings of Tomorrow is the second studio album by the Swedish Heavy metal band Europe. It was released on 24 February 1984, by Hot Records.\\n\\n- Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, dating back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues, and electric blues.\\n\\n- Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.\\n\\n- A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.\\n\\n- Candlemass is an influential Swedish doom metal band established in Stockholm 1984 by bassist, songwriter and bandleader Leif Edling and drummer Matz Ekström. After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Candlemass disbanded in 1994, but reunited three years later. After breaking up again in 2002, Candlemass reformed in 2004 and have continued to record and perform since then.\\nCandlemass is also the seventh best selling artist coming out from Sweden selling as of 2010 more than 15 million albums worldwide.\\n\\n- The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Tony Niemistö (born 10 February 1963 in Danderyd, Stockholm County) is a semi-retired Swedish musician, best known as Tony Reno, the original drummer in the rock band Europe. He played on Europe's first two albums, \\"Europe\\" and \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\". He parted company from the band before the second leg of the \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\" tour in 1984. He was replaced by Ian Haugland.\\n\\n- Jazz fusion (also known as jazz-rock) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.\\n\\n- Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.\\n\\n- Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".\\n\\n- Sigtuna Municipality (\\"Sigtuna kommun\\") is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Märsta, approximately 37 km north of the Swedish capital, Stockholm.\\n\\n- Valsta is a suburban area in the vicinity of Märsta, north of Stockholm, Sweden.\\n\\n- The tuba is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \\"buzz\\" into a large cupped mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid 19th-century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band. The tuba largely replaced the ophicleide. \\"Tuba\\" is Latin for 'trumpet'.\\n\\n- Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.\\n\\n- Märsta (roughly pronounced ) is a suburb of Metropolitan Stockholm, a locality and the seat of Sigtuna Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 27,034 inhabitants in 2015. The town is situated close to Stockholm's main international airport, Arlanda. Even if its origins go back to around 500 AD, Märsta is a widespread modern residential area. Märsta has a mix of multi-storey dwellings and smaller houses. It is in a phase of expansion and new residential areas are built both in central parts of Märsta and in the surrounding areas like for instance Steningehöjden. Märsta can be reached by commuter trains from Stockholm running at quarterly intervals during daytime and by bus from Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The central parts of Märsta has a shopping area \\"Märsta Centrum\\" with various shops, pub and restaurants. Another smaller shopping area is \\"Valsta Centrum\\". East of the central parts of Märsta there is an industrial area and a bit further east close to the airport a shopping mall \\"Eurostop\\". Most parts of Märsta and the municipality of Sigtuna can be reached with local bus services originating at the railway station and also connecting with commuter trains.\\n\\n\\n\\n'ian haugland' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'place of birth'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- allen\\n - band\\n - best\\n - bjälbo\\n - central\\n - christopher\\n - denmark\\n - faroe islands\\n - finland\\n - freshwater\\n - grave\\n - harmony\\n - holm\\n - island\\n - italy\\n - jamaica\\n - king\\n - lead\\n - most\\n - norden\\n - nordreisa\\n - norway\\n - närke\\n - of\\n - orleans\\n - philip\\n - philippines\\n - riga\\n - scandinavia\\n - sigtuna\\n - sousa\\n - southeast\\n - stockholm\\n - strong\\n - sweden\\n - time\\n - tuba\\n - uppland\\n - uppsala\\n - åland islands\\n - östergötland","target":"nordreisa","rationale":"This is a \\"related to\\" question.\\nIn the given context, there are two objects: 'ian haugland' and 'nordreisa'.

This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\\n\\nBlimpton and Jarmel are two neighboring planets in the Harshlan galaxy.

Although Bruce Chatwin initially considered his novel about 80 years of rural family life in the Welsh border country unfilmable , he changed his mind when he saw how keen director Andrew Grieve was to make it and they went together to see some of the places and meet some of the people that Chatwin had been inspired by . Chatwin told Grieve to use the book for his film and make it his own . On the Black Hill begins in the closing years of the 19th century with the marriage of dour , puritanical Welsh farmer Amos Jones ( Bob Peck ) to his social superior , vicar 's daughter Mary Latimer ( Gemma Jones ) after the death of her father ( Mark Dignam ) . Her inheritance and social connections enable them to rent a vacant farm , ' The Vision ' , a situation that is a cause for resentment in their relationship . It is against this background , along with a boundary feud with Watkins , a malicious neighbour , that the twins Lewis ( Robert Gwilym ) and Benjamin ( Mike Gwilym ) grow up . Having come through wars , romance and separation , they are still farming at ' The Vision ' eighty years later . Bob Peck as the gaunt , wild - eyed Amos Jones dominates the early scenes , though he is well matched by Gemma Jones as his wife Mary . With typical thoroughness , Peck immersed himself in the part , learning to ride , plough and pleach hedges . Although the film was made on a tight budget , the director had time to scout out appropriate locations in the area . \`\` We spent far longer researching the locations than we would normally and it was the quality of the landscape and the discovery of the perfect farmhouse at Llanfihangel Nant Bran near Sennybridge which was critical to its success , '' said Grieve at a screening of the film at Borderlines Film Festival in 2006 .

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrete works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers.\\n\\nZappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in mid-1968, and the Zappas moved into a house on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, only to move again to one on Woodrow Wilson Drive. This was Zappa's home for the rest of his life. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially. Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his \\"electrical chamber music\\".  In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing royalties whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for Warner Bros. Records' Reprise subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.  In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).  After he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album Hot Rats (1969). It features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, \\"Peaches en Regalia\\", which reappeared several times on future recordings. He was backed by jazz, blues and R&B session players including violinist Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris, drummers John Guerin and Paul Humphrey, multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the Mothers of Invention Ian Underwood, and multi-instrumentalist Shuggie Otis on bass, along with a guest appearance by Captain Beefheart (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, \\"Willie the Pimp\\").
