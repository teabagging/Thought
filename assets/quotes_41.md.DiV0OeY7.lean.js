Although a number of promising potential vaccines and therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV have been described, no effective antiviral drug against SARS-CoV is currently available. The intricate, sequential nature of the viral entry process provides multiple valid targets for drug development. Here, we describe a rapid and safe cell-based highthroughput screening system, dual envelope pseudovirion (DEP) assay, for specifically screening inhibitors of viral entry. The assay system employs a novel dual envelope strategy, using lentiviral pseudovirions as targets whose entry is driven by the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein. A second, unrelated viral envelope is used as an internal control to reduce the number of false positives. As an example of the power of this assay a class of inhibitors is reported with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV at two steps of the replication cycle, viral entry and particle assembly. This assay system can be easily adapted to screen entry inhibitors against other viruses with the careful selection of matching partner virus envelopes.","target":"Inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry -Identification using an internally-controlled dual envelope pseudovirion assay","rationale":"The title should focus on the fact that, in this study, the authors developed an assay system for specifically screening inhibitors of viral entry and used this assay to identify a class of compounds with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV at two steps of the replication cycle.

Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb.\\nUpon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler.\\nA little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him.\\nJamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find. The next day, the woman drops the Polaroid down to Mrs. Hacker from a window overlooking the pavement.

It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches.

Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\".

The character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a \\"phasing\\" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation.\\n\\nKitty Pryde was introduced into the X-Men title as the result of an editorial dictate that the book was supposed to depict a school for mutants. Uncanny X-Men artist John Byrne named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school, Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary in 1973. He had told Pryde he liked her name and asked for permission to use it, promising to name his first original comics character after her. Byrne drew the character to slightly resemble an adolescent Sigourney Weaver.  The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character's personality were derived from those of X-Men editor Louise Simonson's daughter, Julie. Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed \\"Sprite\\". She was the main character in issues #141-142, the \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline, where she is possessed by her older self, whose consciousness time travels to the past to prevent a mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue miniseries Kitty Pryde and Wolverine (1984-1985), written by Claremont, is a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman, adopting the new name \\"Shadowcat\\".  In the late '80s, she joined the British-based super team, Excalibur, where she remained for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work. She was featured in the 2002 mini-series Mekanix and came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in Astonishing X-Men. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back, she was featured in Jason Aaron's Wolverine and the X-Men and Brian Michael Bendis' All-New X-Men books.  In early 2015, she joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After the Secret Wars event, she adopted her new alias, Star-Lord (first believed to be Star-Lady).  Shadowcat's popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans, she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying she values Byrne's comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat's namesake.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why did she leave for 2 years?","target":"She was featured in the 2002 mini-series Mekanix","rationale":"In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work.

Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town.

Fortunately enough, the shelf life of peanut oil is similar to other oil, which means they last quite a long time. Interesting facts about Peanut Butter: 1  It's a law in the United States that any product labeled peanut butter must contain at least 90% peanuts. 2  It takes about 540 peanuts to make a 12 ounce jar. 3  There is a name for the fear of having peanut butter stick to the roof of your mouth - arachibutyrophobia! The shelf life of peanut butter depends on a variety of factors, such as the best before date, the preparation method and how it was stored. Fresh peanut butter is made of peanuts, that's it! But manufacturers will add oil, salt, sugar and/or other preservatives to their jars. If the oil is open, it is wise to store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh for up to 3 years as well. However, an open container or jar of peanut oil stored in the pantry or on top of the counter will last for a shorter period – about 2 years. That depends on the quality of the peanut oil itself. But what about our favorite foods—peanut butter, peanuts and peanut products? Peanut butter’s shelf life may depend on the way you store it. Follow the guide above and remember to store peanuts in airtight containers. An open jar of peanut butter stays fresh up to three months in the pantry. After that, it’s recommended to store the peanut butter in the fridge (where it can maintain its quality for another 3-4 months). If you don’t refrigerate, oil separation can occur. Here’s a run-down. If the peanut butter begins to smell rancid, toss it. A natural separation of oil is natural, especially in the natural peanut butters that do not contain additional fats as stabilizers. You can tell how long the jar of natural peanut butter has been sitting on the shelf by the amount of oil on top. This oil can be stirred back into the peanut butter if desired, but we prefer to pour most of it into a frying pan and use it for pan frying something for dinner. Peanut Flour, unopened 1 year. Peanut Flour, opened 2-3 months Lasts up to 9 months in refrigerator. Peanut Oil, roasted, aromatic, unopened 9 months. Peanut Oil, roasted, aromatic, opened 2 months Lasts 4-6 months in refrigerator. You can help peanut butter keep fresh longer by storing it in your fridge immediately after use, although processed peanut butter will be fine on the shelf as well. Once prepared (if homemade) or opened from the jar, it should be stored in a tightly closed container. If this fat is combined with other oils, it will typically last the longest, but pure peanut oil left open is best in terms of quality if you use it up before the expiration date on the bottle it comes in. Image used under Creative Commons from ratna rajaiah. How long does peanut oil stay good for in frying appliances? Whenever you are using peanut oil to cook food in fryolators it is wise to only use the only three to four times because it tends to take on the flavors of the foods you cook in it and loses its quality quickly after coming in contact with foods and being heated repeatedly.

In quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as 'QED vacuum' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics, denoted as QCD vacuum. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no photons. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally.

Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.","target":"quantum chromodynamics","rationale":"According to the options, quantum chromodynamics is the only field that does not define a vacuum as also free of all photons.

Testosterone (T) decline is primarily investigated, while age-related changes in other sex steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], estradiol [E2], progesterone [P]) are mostly neglected. An integrated hormone parameter reflecting aging processes in men has yet to be identified. 271 self-reporting healthy men between 40 and 75 provided both psychometric data and saliva samples for hormone analysis. Correlation analysis between age and sex steroids revealed negative associations for the four sex steroids (T, DHEA, E2, and P). Principal component analysis including ten salivary analytes identified a principal component mainly unifying the variance of the four sex steroid hormones. Subsequent principal component analysis including the four sex steroids extracted the principal component of declining steroid hormones (DSH). Moderation analysis of the association between age and DSH revealed significant moderation effects for psychosocial factors such as depression, chronic stress and perceived general health. In conclusion, these results provide further evidence that sex steroids decline in aging men and that the integrated hormone parameter DSH and its rate of change can be used as biomarkers for healthy aging in men. Furthermore, the negative association of age and DSH is moderated by psychosocial factors..

This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch.

Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV \\"a threat to the entire world.\\" This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered.

In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level.

This association is maintained even when the sleep-wake cycle is desynchronized from the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin. Administration of melatonin during the day increases daytime sleep propensity as indexed by both the latency to sleep onset and sleep consolidation. The EEG during daytime sleep after melatonin administration exhibits characteristics reminiscent of the nocturnal sleep EEG, that is, increased sleep spindle activity and reduced slow-wave sleep and slow-wave activity, as detected by quantitative EEG analysis. Administration of higher doses of melatonin (5 mg or more) prior to nocturnal sleep results in an increase in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These data demonstrate that melatonin exerts effects on the main characteristics of human sleep, that is, latency to sleep onset, sleep consolidation, slow waves, sleep spindles, and REM sleep.

She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said. \\n\\nDecide whether \\"Sixty Two\\" is a valid answer to the following question: How old was Joan when she wrote an autobiography?\\nAnswer yes or no.","target":"Yes","rationale":"Joan Fontaine wrote her autobiography \\"No Bed of Roses\\" in 1978, when she was 62 years old.

Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\"\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: In recent years Indonesia has seen widespread habitat destruction.

Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission.

Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit.

The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government.

Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father.\\n\\nBeginning in 1919, Hearst began to build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a 240,000 acres (97,000 hectares) ranch at San Simeon, California, which he furnished with art, antiques and entire rooms brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier).  He also had a property on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, in far northern California, called Wyntoon. Wyntoon was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle and worked in collaboration with William J. Dodd on a number of other projects.  In 1947, Hearst paid $120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres three blocks from Sunset Boulevard. This home, known as Beverly House, was once perhaps the \\"most expensive\\" private home in the U.S., valued at $165 million (PS81.4 million). It has 29 bedrooms, three swimming pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went on the market for $95 million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of $135 million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s.  In the early 1890s, Hearst began building a mansion on the hills overlooking Pleasanton, California on land purchased by his father a decade earlier. Hearst's mother took over the project, hired Julia Morgan to finish it as her home, and named it Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club from 1925 to 1969, when it was destroyed in a massive fire.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"William Randolph Hearst","rationale":"The context talks about one person, William Randolph Hearst Sr. In the first paragraph, it states that he was an American businessman and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest media company, which is why his name appears in the title of this passage. \\nHearst Castle and Wyntoon are mentioned as two different properties where Hearst resided for a period of time along with other places such as Beverly Hills mansion (Beverly House), Pleasanton hills overlooking California etc. These can be considered synonyms to residences occupied by him or merely some locations associated to his life story described here.

In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Titans kicker Rob Bironas got a 49-yard field goal, along with RB LenDale White getting a 6-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Tennessee increased its lead with White getting a 2-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Chiefs continued to struggle as Bironas got a 46-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Titans began to put the game out of reach as White got an 80-yard TD run. Kansas City would finally get on the board as kicker Nick Novak got a 26-yard field goal. Tennessee would seal the win as RB Chris Johnson got a 66-yard TD run. The Chiefs would end the game with QB Tyler Thigpen getting a 14-yard TD run. During the game starting QB Brodie Croyle (9/10 for 63&#160;yards) suffered a sprained knee in the second quarter. Also, veteran QB Damon Huard (9/16 for 96&#160;yards) later left the game in the fourth with an injured thumb. Both would be placed on injured reserve, ending their seasons. To help Tyler Thigpen prepare for the game against the Jets, the Chiefs implemented the spread offense to help Thigpen and the rest of the younger players play to the best of their abilities, and also following the absence of RB Larry Johnson due to suspension. The Chiefs made a huge gamble by doing so, as most in the NFL believe that a spread offense cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans. Prior to the Chiefs implementing the spread offense, Thigpen had been playing erratically with the Chiefs, and he suddenly became poised and effective running the new offense.\\n\\nWho scored rushing touchdowns over 50 yards?","target":"LenDale White","rationale":"The goal of this problem is to find the player who scored rushing touchdowns over 50 yards.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles.\\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\\nThe group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before.

Passage:In 1996, Canterbury was reunited with Knight, who had been renamed Phineas I. Godwinn. The duo were portrayed as being cousins (later brothers) and were collectively known as \\"The Godwinns\\". The two were faces and were managed by Hillbilly Jim. They began to feud with the Body Donnas with Phineas having a crush on Sunny and signed her as their manager. They would beat the Body Donnas for the WWF Tag Team Championships. Eventually Sunny turned on them costing them their titles. The Godwinns feuded with the now heel Smoking Gunns, in losing efforts. In 1997, the Godwinns began a heel turn dropping Hillbilly Jim as a manager and picking up Uncle Cletus. The Godwinns quickly won the tag titles a second time from The Headbangers and began a heated feud with the Legion of Doom, which saw the team attempt to break Road Warrior Hawk's neck.

In order to further elucidate the significance of lipids in the water-holding properties, lipids, which were extracted as sebaceous-rich lipids (SL) for the first 10-min acetone/ether treatment and as stratum corneum lipids (SCL) for the additional 30-min treatment, were topically applied daily on lipid-depleted forearm skin which had been pretreated with acetone/ether for 40 min. Two daily applications of the SCL which were solubilized in squalane containing 1% alpha-monomethyl heptadecyl glyceryl ether (GE) caused a significant increase of conductance, accompanied by a marked improvement in the level of scaling as compared with nontreatment or GE/squalane base, whereas the SL in the GE/squalane base did not exhibit any significant recovery in either conductance value or scaling. To clarify which components of the SCL are primarily responsible for the observed recovery of the water-holding properties, chromatographically separated fractions of the SCL were also topically applied in the same manner for 2 successive days. Out of the following separated fractions: cholesterol, cholesterol ester, free fatty acid, glycolipids, and ceramide, 2 daily topical applications of ceramide fraction induced a significant and the highest increase in the conductance value as compared with GE/squalane base. Furthermore, glycolipids and cholesterol fractions also exhibited a significant recovery when compared with no application at all. In contrast, free fatty acid and cholesterol ester fractions did not indicate any significant increase in the conductance value. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that structural lipids present in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum, especially ceramide, play a critical role in the water-holding properties of the stratum corneum. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Selective recovery of deranged water-holding properties by stratum corneum lipids. option2: A molecular gradient in early Drosophila embryos and its role in specifying the body pattern.","target":"Selective recovery of deranged water-holding properties by stratum corneum lipids","rationale":"The abstract is a description of research that investigated the water-holding properties of stratum corneum lipids in humans.

The rough team slashed a player, ok time in the box, and then the same guy straight up punched a guy at face off, more time in the box, at this point the other team is getting angry. And the referees begun to take notice, at this point the parents and the player got angry saying the other player got in his way and it shouldn’t be his penalty, but surprise that’s not how it works. And the same dude decides to basically stab his stick into someone’s shoulder pad. That’s the final straw he was asked to leave, while doing this his parents went mad and started to swear and threaten the referees and anyone who doesn’t support his team. She was asked to leave as well. After this the game ended normally ( only had 10 minute on the clock anyway) and when I was done changing the parent was waiting for me.

While numerous studies have been conducted, most existing works assume that the data from different sources or across different locations are equally reliable. Due to cost, accessibility, or other factors, it is inevitable that the data quality could vary, which introduces significant biases into the model and leads to unreliable prediction results. The problem could be exacerbated in black-box prediction models, such as deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that can automatically infer data quality levels of different sources through local variations of spatiotemporal signals without explicit labels. Furthermore, we integrate the estimate of data quality level with graph convolutional networks to exploit their efficient structures. We evaluate our proposed method on forecasting temperatures in Los Angeles.","target":"We propose a method that infers the time-varying data quality level for spatiotemporal forecasting without explicitly assigned labels","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose a method that infers the time-varying data quality level for spatiotemporal forecasting without explicitly assigned labels."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a statement spoken by a politician in natural language and the subject of the discussion for the given statement.

The third sentence tells us that he sold 15 pieces on Monday. However, we need to solve for how many pieces he sold on Tuesday. We can do this by subtracting 80 - 15 = 65 to get 65 remaining after his sale on Monday. Next, we are told that he sold more than 15 pieces on Tuesday but have no indication of how much more, so we can say X > 15. Then, the next sentence states that by Wednesday he only had 7 remaining and gives us a new value of 7 leftover from his initial supply (80). We can use this information to solve for X because in one day's time his remaining candies must have gone down by 65-7 = 58 between Tuesday and Wednesday sales. So Jake must have sold at least 58 candies on Tuesday because any less would leave him with more than 7 leftover when Wednesday arrives.\\""},{"source":"Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that has the most similar style to the prompt.

Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'

Due to her longevity and resilience within the industry, she is referred to as the \\"Queen of Japanese Pop\\" and has constantly been recognized as the Japanese equivalent to leading Western artists such as Madonna and Janet Jackson. Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted at age 14 as an idol singer in the band Super Monkey's.\\n\\nAfter signing with Avex Trax in 1995, the corresponding record company Avex Group enlisted Japanese musician Tetsuya Komuro to work with Amuro on her then-upcoming album. Amuro made her solo debut with Avex, releasing the single \\"Body Feels Exit\\" on October 25, 1995. It became a huge success in Japan, peaking at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart and sold over 881,000 units in that region. Amuro's second single with Komuro, \\"Chase the Chance\\", became her first number single on the Oricon Singles Chart, and became her first single to sell over one million units there. For Amuro's success with those singles, she won the Golden Arrow Award in 1995. After a brief hiatus, Amuro released two more singles in 1996: \\"Don't Wanna Cry\\" and \\"You're My Sunshine\\". Both singles were successful in Japan, bringing her second and third consecutive number one singles, and both sold over one million units there. Amuro achieved huge success after the release of her first solo studio album, Sweet 19 Blues (1996). Released on July 22, it reached number one on the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan, and has sold over 3.6 million units.

On November 27, 1996, she started work on her second solo studio album with Komuro, and released its lead single \\"A Walk in the Park\\". It gave Amuro her fourth number one single on the Oricon Singles Chart, and her fourth single to sell over one million units there. At the end of 1996, she was awarded the Grand Prix Award for her song \\"Don't Wanna Cry\\", the highest honor at the Japan Record Awards, making her the youngest artist to have won the award. On February 19, 1997, she released her single \\"Can You Celebrate?\\", which became her fifth number one single. The single became a huge success in Japan, eventually selling 2.29 million units there, making it the best-selling single by a solo female artist in Japan.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.\\nThe company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford.

He had spells with Norwich City, Cambridge United, Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic.\\n\\nDublin was controversially excluded from the England 1998 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997-98 season, alongside Michael Owen and Chris Sutton. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for PS5.75 million. In his first four games for the club, he would score 7 goals including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for the Villans. As a result, he is one of only six players to score in the first four consecutive games for a Premier League club.  In December 1999, whilst playing for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday, he sustained a life-threatening broken neck, as a result of which he permanently has a titanium plate holding three neck vertebrae together. Just days before suffering this injury, it was reported in the News of the World that Dublin would soon be sold by Aston Villa for a fee of around PS6million as the club looked to finance a fall in its share value as a result of manager John Gregory's heavy expenditure on players.  Incredibly, the injury did not end Dublin's career and he was back in action three months later.  In April 2000, a week after returning to the team, he helped Aston Villa reach their first FA Cup final in 43 years, which they lost 1-0 against Chelsea, scoring a penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers. Having regained his fitness, Dublin remained on the Villa Park payroll until 2002.  Faced with competition for a first team place by Juan Pablo Angel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County, and Grimsby Town in five league matches to help them into the play-offs where despite Dublin's goal in the first leg of the semi final, Millwall lost to Birmingham City 2-1 on aggregate.

In doing so, I moved out of my parents’ house.\\n\\nI have anxiety and regularly (especially in the evening) experience rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, feeling of a “pit” in my stomach, fatigue, etc. This happens more frequently when I am alone. The symptoms became much worse when I left home and went off to college, decreased significantly when I moved home, and have now started up again. I’ve had what I would consider a panic attack/episode at least 3 times in the past week. I believe this has to do with me moving out, my parents separating (very recent) after my dad having an affair, and my boyfriend starting a job that he works in the evenings, which leaves me alone for long stretches of time.\\n\\nI would like to get an emotional support animal to help alleviate some of these symptoms. My (technically my family’s) puppy at my parents’ house was always able to distract and comfort me when I was particularly anxious. I believe that I would legitimately qualify for an emotional support animal.\\n\\nHowever, my issue is that doctors (any health professionals really) are major triggers for my anxiety. Because of this, I would like to obtain a letter via an online service or some sort of teletherapy (the most legit I can find). Note that this would NOT be a registration/certification. I know these are scams. There seem to be services out there that can legally do this, but I know that online services like this are often scams that make life more difficult for people with service animals and even “real” ESAs, which I don’t want to support.\\n\\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for using a legal but ethically questionable online service for obtaining an ESA letter?

This has been shown to have positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students as well as the teaching of faculty members. According to a study by Geoffrey Maruyama and José F. Moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed diversity helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education, Caucasian students suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity, and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions. Furthermore, a diverse population of students offers unique perspectives in order to challenge preconceived notions through exposure to the experiences and ideas of others. According to Professor Gurin of the University of Michigan, skills such as \\"perspective-taking, acceptance of differences, a willingness and capacity to find commonalities among differences, acceptance of conflict as normal, conflict resolution, participation in democracy, and interest in the wider social world\\" can potentially be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students. In addition, broadening perspectives helps students confront personal and substantive stereotypes and fosters discussion about racial and ethnic issues in a classroom setting.

Therefore, small gradients indicate a good value of the weight that requires no change and can be kept frozen during training. This paper provides an experimental study on the importance of a neural network weights, and to which extent do they need to be updated. We wish to show that starting from the third epoch, freezing weights which have no informative gradient and are less likely to be changed during training, results in a very slight drop in the overall accuracy (and in sometimes better).

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps.

Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which river flows into a sea with stronger tidal currents?","target":"Danube","rationale":"The Danube flows into the Black Sea, which has strong tidal currents.

Passage 1:Merlin Jay Olsen (; September 15, 1940 – March 11, 2010) was an American football player, announcer, and actor. He played his entire 15-year professional football career in National Football League (NFL) as a defensive tackle with the Los Angeles Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl a record 14 straight times, missing selection only in the last year of his career. This record of 14 seasons selected to play in the Pro Bowl, consecutive or otherwise, is shared with current New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, former offensive lineman Bruce Matthews, former tight end Tony Gonzalez, and former quarterback Peyton Manning. A recipient of the 1961 Outland Trophy as the best lineman in college football, Olsen is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. As an actor, he portrayed farmer Jonathan Garvey on Little House on the Prairie. After leaving that series, he starred in his own NBC drama, Father Murphy.\\n Passage 2:On April 3, 2014, Houston hired Kelvin Sampson as the new Cougars head coach. Sampson had just become eligible to be a college coach again after receiving a five-year show cause penalty in 2008 for sanctions against him during his time as Indiana head coach. In 2014–15, Houston struggled again, finishing with a 13–19 record and 4–14 in the AAC. The 2015–16 team led a resurgence, finishing 22–10, 12–6, but lost in the AAC Tournament and in the first round of the NIT. In 2017–18, the Cougars compiled a 27–8 record, reaching the finals of the AAC Tournament and winning a game in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1984. In 2018–19, the Cougars' success continued as they set a program record for wins with a 33–4 mark. They were AAC regular-season champions but fell in the finals of the conference tournament.

He also sang in Toscanini's February 6, 1938, NBC Symphony Orchestra's broadcast performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. These performances both took place in Carnegie Hall. In March 1942, Pinza was arrested at his home and unjustly detained 3 months on Ellis Island with hundreds of other Italian-Americans who were suspected of supporting the Axis. The incident was extremely traumatic for Pinza, and he suffered from severe depression for years afterward.

Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA), fetal cord serum (FCS), or maternal serum (MS) did not enhance or reduce the blastulation rates (medium alone, 89.4%; BSA, 86.4%; FCS, 90%; MS, 74.7%). Unsupplemented Ham's F-10 medium was found to contain three major peaks of approximately 50,000 daltons and several minor peaks, analyzed on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), suggesting the presence of protein(s) in the medium itself. The storing of medium up to 425 days at 4 degrees C affected neither the HPLC profile nor its ability to support embryo growth (blastulation rates: fresh, 84%; stored 150 to 425 days, 77.7%). The coating of surgical gloves affected embryo growth. Both talc-coated (TC) and \\"talc-free,\\" starch-coated (SC) surgical gloves were found to be progressively embryotoxic when they touched the medium for increasing lengths of time, compared with uncoated latex (UL) gloves and untouched control medium. Quality control of medium preparation and handling in murine embryo bioassay is reemphasized, with requirements for protein supplementation, use of fresh medium, and possible contamination with even talc-free, SC surgical gloves reevaluated. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Factors influencing murine embryo bioassay: effects of proteins, aging of medium, and surgical glove coatings. option2: Policies of U.S. medical schools on the use of the NBME Part I and Part II examinations.","target":"Factors influencing murine embryo bioassay: effects of proteins, aging of medium, and surgical glove coatings","rationale":"option1: Factors influencing murine embryo bioassay: effects of proteins, aging of medium, and surgical glove coatings.\\\\noption2: Policies of U.S. medical schools on the use of the NBME Part I and Part II examinations\\n\\nThe abstract describes a study that evaluated the effects of different factors (i.e., protein supplements, medium aging, and surgical glove coatings) on embryo growth in a murine embryology bioassay assay for quality control in human IVF procedures.

The Moon casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun. This happens only all three are lined up and in the same plane. This plane is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of Earths orbit around the Sun. The Moons shadow has two distinct parts. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow. It is the part in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Moons shadow. It is where the light is only partially blocked. When the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar eclipse (Figure 24.21). If only part of the Sun is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare events. They usually only last a few minutes. That is because the Moons shadow only covers a very small area on Earth and Earth is turning very rapidly. Solar eclipses are amazing to experience. It appears like night only strange. Birds may sing as they do at dusk. Stars become visible in the sky and it gets colder outside. Unlike at night, the Sun is out. So during a solar eclipse, its easy to see the Suns corona and solar prominences. This NASA page will inform you on when solar eclipses are expected: [Link] Sometimes a full moon moves through Earths shadow. This is a lunar eclipse (Figure 24.22). During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. When the Moon passes through Earths penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earths shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. The Moon glows with a dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse. The Moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light from the Sun. As the Moon moves around the Earth, we see different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun. This causes the phases of the Moon. As the Moon revolves around Earth, it changes from fully lit to completely dark and back again. A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun. About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the Moons lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, the side facing Earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the Moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the Moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the Moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.","target":"outer part of the moons shadow during an eclipse","rationale":"The answer should be a continous text span from the given passage.

At the turn of the 17th century, three of these states emerged as the leading powers: the Sultanate of Banten in western Java, the Sultanate of Mataram in inland central Java, and the Duchy of Surabaya in coastal eastern Java. Mataram consolidated its power by absorbing other principalities: Pajang in c. 1588, Demak , Madiun  and Kediri . Following Mataram's unsuccessful westward expedition against Banten in about 1597, Mataram turned its expansion eastward, into areas under the influence of Surabaya. The Duchy of Surabaya was centered roughly in today's city of Surabaya in the northern coast of eastern Java. It was a wealthy and powerful state, and the city was an important port in the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands., The city was approximately 37 kilometres  in circumference, and was fortified by canals and cannons. Allied with the nearby state of Pasuruan, the Duchy expanded its influence throughout the eastern part of Java in the beginning of the 17th century. By 1622, it was in control of Gresik and Sedayu in eastern Java. It was also the overlord of Sukadana and Banjarmasin in southern Borneo. More doubtful reports said it might have also extended its influence to Pasuruan, Blambangan, the Brantas valley region, and Wirasaba. Other than these, Surabaya was also allied with Tuban, Malang, Kediri, Lasem, all in eastern Java, as well as Madura off the northern coast.

Best known as a founder member of the band Pink Floyd, Barrett was the lead singer, guitarist and principal songwriter in its early years and is credited with naming the band. Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 after David Gilmour took over as their new guitarist, and was briefly hospitalised amid speculation of mental illness. Barrett was musically active for less than ten years.\\n\\nThe second album, Barrett, was recorded more sporadically than the first, with sessions taking place between February and July 1970. The album was produced by David Gilmour, and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Richard Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley. The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the \\"Barrett-ness\\". One track (\\"Rats\\") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett's playing: \\"He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic.\\" At times Barrett, who experienced synaesthesia, would say: \\"Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it's too windy and icy\\".  These sessions were happening while Pink Floyd had just begun to work on Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett went to \\"spy\\" on the band as they recorded their album.  Wright said of the Barrett sessions:  Doing Syd's record was interesting, but extremely difficult. Dave [Gilmour] and Roger did the first one (The Madcap Laughs) and Dave and myself did the second one.

During the morning skate, José Théodore suffered a hip flexor injury, forcing the Capitals to recall Semyon Varlamov from their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears. However, Varlamov was with the Bears in San Antonio, Texas and was unable to make it to Washington in time to start the game as the backup goaltender. As a result, the Capitals were forced to dress three goaltenders, signing Leonhardt, the team's website producer, to an amateur tryout contract before the game to back up Brent Johnson until the arrival of Varlamov. Because of his experience in NCAA Division III ice hockey with the State University of New York at Oswego and Neumann College, as well as the Kitchener Dutchmen of the GOJHL, Leonhardt had previously participated in on-ice practice sessions with the Capitals, filling in when an additional goaltender was needed. Varlamov arrived 9:03 into the first period and replaced Leonhardt as Johnson's backup for the remainder of the game. Had Leonhardt played in the game, he would have tied Ben Bishop as the tallest goalie in NHL history. He did not receive any pay for his contract. These bizarre circumstances were remarkably similar to those the Vancouver Canucks faced on December 9, 2003, when starting goaltender Dan Cloutier suffered a groin injury during the morning skate, forcing the Canucks to sign University of British Columbia goaltender Chris Levesque to an amateur tryout contract.\\n Link Information: Formal consolidation of the I-AHL. two seasons of interlocking play, the governors of the two leagues' seven active teams met in New York City on June 28, 1938, and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate.

The bill was passed on a party line vote, with Knight's fellow Progressive Conservatives voting unanimously in favour and the opposition Liberals and New Democrats voting unanimously against. Knight also sponsored the Securities Amendment Acts, separate bills with the same name from different years, 2005 and 2006. The first of these was designed to harmonize the securities regulation with that of other provinces. It was supported by Liberals Rick Miller and Bill Bonko, who considered it a step in the right direction. New Democrats gave it a mixed reception, with Ray Martin agreeing that it did make some improvements, but with his colleague David Eggen trying to kill it on third reading, saying that what was needed was a supra-provincial securities regulator. The 2006 edition of the Securities Amendment Act implemented further harmonization, and passed with little debate. The Securities Transfer Act of the same year consolidated and harmonized the province's rules for transferring securities, and passed with all-party support.\\n Passage 3:On January 13, UFC revealed this event was originally intended to take place at Arena da Baixada (a much larger venue) in Curitiba, Brazil, and feature a UFC Heavyweight Championship rematch between champion Fabrício Werdum and former two-time champion Cain Velasquez, with former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva in the co-main event slot, possibly against Michael Bisping.

Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997.

In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller.

Plans included 500 homes for Navy personnel, a child-development center and a Navy lodge.In planning the island's development, the Navy considered its operational needs and the island's historic value. However, the National Trust for Historic Preservation considered the Navy's communication style more directive rather than collaborative, restricting the NTHP's ability to share their concerns, and in 2001 designated Ford Island one of its 11 most-endangered sites. Although the Navy's plans included preserving important hangars, the control tower and seaplane ramps, they failed to protect the existing runway and 1920s housing and did not address preserving bullet holes on the seaplane ramps.  As hoped by the Trust, after the designation the Navy agreed to delay development of some of these items until an agreement could be reached.To accommodate additional facilities and housing, the Navy needed to upgrade the island's infrastructure. Its sewage system was upgraded with the 2001 installation of a 6,000-foot (1,800 m), 20-inch (510 mm) sewage main from the island to Pearl Harbor and improvements to the sewage-pumping station.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c.

This study quantitated the influence of weight gain on birth weight and identified rates and total amounts of weight gain related to the birth of healthy-sized infants to healthy low-income women who entered pregnancy underweight, at normal weight, overweight, or obese. Data used in the study were obtained from randomly sampled prenatal health records from Maternal and Infant Care (MIC) projects in Cleveland and Minneapolis. Subsamples of healthy mothers who delivered healthy-sized infants were identified from each sample, and rates and total amounts of weight gain by prepregnancy weight status group were calculated. There were 384 healthy mother and healthy-sized infant pairs in the Cleveland subsample and 75 such pairs in the Minneapolis sample. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of prenatal weight gain and birth weight varied depending on prepregnancy weight status. Prenatal weight gains related to the birth of healthy-sized infants (newborns with birth weights of 3,000 to 4,500 gm) to healthy mothers in the Cleveland MIC sample averaged 33 lb for underweight, 32 lb for normal weight, 29 lb for overweight, and 19 lb for obese women. Except for obese women, rates and total amount of weight gain associated with the birth of healthy-sized infants were equivalent for the two samples. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract presents numerical data related to the influence of weight gain on birth weight.

One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as phonetically longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while it is true that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7.

They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term (193337) of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The album marked a return from lead singer Martha Reeves, recovering from a time in a mental institution after an addiction to painkillers nearly wrecked her (though it still took her until 1977 to beat her addiction). This was the next-to-last album for the Vandellas, whose success had peaked in the mid-1960s.\\n\\n- A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.

A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\n\\n- Robert Fechner (22 March 1876  31 December 1939) was a national labor union leader and director of the Civilian Conservation Corps (193339), which played a central role in the development of state and national parks in the United States. Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. With only a public school elementary education he had risen to become an American labor union leader and vice president of the International Association of Machinists. He had a reputation for fairness, tact, and patience in all his dealings. On 5 April 1933 he was appointed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be the Director of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was Fechner's fairness and ability for organization and administration that impressed the president to his appointment as director. Although he had been an important labor figure, Fechner objected to attempts of union organizers to form unions among CCC enrollees in the camps. He felt that the government was doing all it possibly could for the well-being of the enrollees: well fed, supporting dependents with monthly earnings, getting an education; and they were contributing in a constructive manner to the conservation needs of the nation. The need for a union in this situation was not necessary, and he issued orders to keep union organizers out of the CCC camps and gave instructions that if any of the CCC enrolees joined a union they were to be discharged. Upon Fechner's death while still serving as CCC Director he was succeeded by James McEntee.\\n\\n- Franklin Delano Roosevelt (his own pronunciation, or ; January 30, 1882  April 12, 1945), commonly known as FDR, was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. \\n\\n- British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. \\nBritish Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.\\n\\n- Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity.

The park is the largest of the three National Park Service units that comprise the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. Several national wilderness areas and British Columbia parkland adjoin the National Park.

Although the country spent two months with declining GDP, it was not until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929 that the effects of a declining economy were felt, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued. The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement. Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future.\\n\\n- The Civilian Conservation Corps (\\"CCC\\") was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families as part of the New Deal. Originally for young men ages 1825, it was eventually expanded to young men ages 1728. Robert Fechner was the head of the agency. It was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men, and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States. At the same time, it implemented a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory. Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000. Over the course of its nine years in operation, 3 million young men participated in the CCC, which provided them with shelter, clothing, and food, together with a small wage of $30 (about $547 in 2015) a month ($25 of which had to be sent home to their families).\\n\\n- The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations.

Lord considers it as much a traditional \\"cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid\\". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, \\"I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place.\\"The Herb Garden contains sage, thyme, hyssop, fennel and an unusual seat built around a camomile bush.

Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.\\n\\nA frequent critic of the U.S. tax system, Kovacs owed the Internal Revenue Service several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes, due to his simple refusal to pay the bulk of them. Up to 90% of his earnings were garnished as a result. His long battles with the IRS inspired Kovacs to invest his money in a convoluted series of paper corporations in the U.S. and Canada. He would give them bizarre names, such as \\"The Bazooka Dooka Hicka Hocka Hookah Company\\". In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes; that same day he bought the California Racquet Club with the apparent hope of being able to use it as a tax write-off. The property had mortgages at the time of purchase which were later paid by Edie Adams.  His tax woes also affected Kovacs's career, forcing him to take any offered work to pay his debt. This included the ABC game show Take A Good Look, appearances on variety shows such as NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, and some of his less memorable movie roles. He also filmed an unaired 1962 pilot episode for a proposed CBS series, Medicine Man (co-starring Buster Keaton, pilot episode titled \\"A Pony For Chris\\"). Kovacs's role was that of Dr. P. Crookshank, a traveling medicine salesman in the 1870s selling Mother McGreevy's Wizard Juice, also known as \\"man's best friend in a bottle\\". This was abandoned after his death, which occurred the day after filming some scenes for the pilot in Griffith Park. CBS initially intended to broadcast the show as part of a summer replacement program, The Comedy Spot, but decided against it due to problems with Kovacs's estate. The pilot is part of the public collection of the Paley Center for Media.  Some of the issues regarding Kovacs's tax problems were still unresolved years after his death. Kovacs had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961. To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. The court's early 1966 ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: \\"Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done Mary Kovacs.\\"  Adams, who married and divorced twice after Kovacs's death, refused help from celebrity friends who planned a benefit for the purpose. Saying \\"I can take care of my own children\\", and being determined to accept offers only from those who wanted to hire her for her talents, Adams managed to pay all of Kovacs' debts.\\n\\nWhen did Ernie exihibt tax evasion?","target":"1961,","rationale":"The article states \\"In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes\\".

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.\\n\\nand the situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B.

Any solar energy that you do not use simultaneous with production will go back into the electrical grid through the meter. At night or on cloudy days, when your system is not producing more than your building needs, you will consume electricity from the grid as normal. Touted as a promising alternative energy source for decades, solar panels crown rooftops and roadside signs, and help keep spacecraft powered. But how do solar panels work? Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together make up a solar panel. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon — the same stuff used in microelectronics. To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field. In addition, the nation’s solar capacity by the end of 2016 is projected to be double what it was at the beginning of 2015, while costs continue to decline and panel efficiencies increase. The question many people have is: How exactly do those panels work? The diagram above illustrates the operation of a basic photovoltaic cell, also called a solar cell. Solar cells are made of the same kinds of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, used in the microelectronics industry. For solar cells, a thin semiconductor wafer is specially treated to form an electric field, positive on one side and negative on the other. When light energy strikes the solar cell, electrons are knocked loose from the atoms in the semiconductor material. What's the biggest difference between how a plant captures light energy and how we do it with solar cells? We wish we could do what plants do because plants absorb the light, and [they use] that electron to change a chemical bond inside the plant to actually make fuel. Could you do artificial photosynthesis and emulate a plant? We would love to be able to make a solar cell that instead of making electricity makes fuel. That would be a very big advance. Solar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are based on a high-tech but remarkably simple technology that converts sunlight directly to electricity < PREVIOUS: The Solar Resource | NEXT: Rooftop Solar Panels > It's an idea that has been around for well over a century. Sun Activation. 1  Photons bombard and penetrate the cell. 2  They activate electrons, knocking them loose in both silicon layers. 3  Some electrons in the bottom layer sling-shot to the top of the cell. 4  These electrons flow into metal contacts as electricity, moving into a circuit throughout a 60-cell module. How Solar Panels Work How a PV cell makes electricity Under the sun, a photovoltaic cell acts as a photosensitive diode that instantaneously converts light – but not heat – into electricity. Basic Steps in Solar Energy Generation and Transmission. 1  Sunlight hits the solar panels, and creates an electric field. 2  The electricity generated flows to the edge of the panel, and into a conductive wire. 3  The conductive wire brings the electricity to the inverter, where it is transformed from DC electricity to AC, which is used to power buildings.

The number of receptors on a target cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity. Hormones can affect cells directly through intracellular hormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane hormone receptors. Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones can enter the cell by diffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to DNA to regulate gene transcription and to change the cell’s activities by inducing production of proteins that affect, in general, the long-term structure and function of the cell. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the plasma membrane surface and trigger a signaling pathway to change the cell’s activities by inducing production of various cell products that affect the cell in the short-term. The hormone is called a first messenger and the cellular component is called a second messenger. G-proteins activate the second messenger (cyclic AMP), triggering the cellular response. Response to hormone binding is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. Cellular responses to hormones include the production of proteins and enzymes and altered membrane permeability.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- able cells\\n\\n- fighter cells\\n\\n- reach cells\\n\\n- target cells\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"target cells","rationale":"The question is asking which cells receive the hormones. The paragraph discusses how cellular changes are caused by binding to receptors on target cells, and that hormone activity determines the number of these receptors.

Ayatollah Khomeini assumed control of the country. The Shah was exiled to Egypt and later went to the U.S. to receive cancer treatments.

The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize.

The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere's eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once.\\nDecades of studies of bird groups led researchers to predict extra alertness in the end-of-the-row sleepers which tend to be attacked more easily. Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze  direction.\\nAlso, birds napping   at the end of the line depend on single-hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Turning 16 birds through the positions in a four-duck row, the researchers found that compared with 12 percent for birds in inner spots, outer birds half-asleep during some 32 percent of napping time.\\n\\"We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness at the same time in different regions of the brain,\\" the researchers say.\\nThe results provide the best evidence for a long-standing assumption that single-hemisphere sleep developed over time as creatures scanned for enemies.

Although early disruptions of the blood-brain barrier appear to be an important risk factor for tissue plasminogen activator-related hemorrhages in rodents, little is known about their incidence and consequences in human stroke.', \\"This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected stroke database over the past 6 years. In 52 patients, multimodal MRI (including diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and postcontrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to detect blood-brain barrier changes) had been performed immediately before systemic thrombolysis and in 48 patients within a median of 30 minutes (interquartile range: 30 to 60 minutes) after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment. The incidence of symptomatic hemorrhage (SICH), defined as any parenchymal hemorrhage leading to deterioration in the patient's clinical condition, was related to several clinical and imaging variables, including early blood-brain barrier changes.\\", 'Overall, SICH was detected in 9 (9%) patients and among these, 2 died.

I am the only child and my parents split when I was little, so it was normal for me to have two homes. I lived with my mum majority of the time and saw my father every second weekend.\\n\\nIt’s been going on for a while where I would plead with mum to not take me to my father’s house. I was 12 when I first asked to take me home instead because I didn’t want to go. There’s so many reasons to list why, but in summary; he picked on my weight - subtle digs here and there, roll his eyes whenever I said something and never made me feel appreciated or loved. I’ve never heard him say that he was proud of me despite my achievements. There’s so many more things to go on about, like how he didn’t come to important events in my life, like my 18th birthday, or how he would prevent my mum from swapping weekends around so I could spend time with family. \\n\\nMy father got into a relationship with his now fiancée 3 years ago. About 10 months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent surgery and the cancer was removed. She’s in the process of radiation treatment now and is slowly getting better.\\n\\nLast time I saw them, we went into the city and it was fine. He made some horrible remarks about how much money he makes which made the day turn sour. Like I mentioned before, his fiancée is currently undergoing treatment for her cancer and so she has had to have some time off work up until recently. He made a ‘joke’ about how he “makes more money at home on the couch than she does at work” and how he has “been holding up this family.” This made me so angry because he has never provided for me and he was belittling his fiancée. My father never offered to pay for my books for high school or uniforms. My mother supported me to get to where I am now by herself. The only time he would pay for anything was when she begged him to. My mum is a single parent, who up to very recently had a small income that only went to the necessities and she really struggled with anything else. So, it’s fair to say that I didn’t see much support from him.\\n\\nI decided to stop speaking to him from that moment forward. I had removed him from Facebook and haven’t had any contact with him since I saw him in January. Monday just gone, I had gotten a phone call around 9:30pm from his fiancée. I was an emotional wreck, talking about my father the last few months has been a major trigger point for me and causes panic attacks and breakdowns. It’s not pretty. She told me that her cancer has a high likelihood of coming back and that she has a 6% chance of survival on the next 5 years.\\n\\nAfter that call, I was in hysterics. I had to explain to her why I didn’t want to see them because of my father and I was just told she may not be here in 5 years time. \\n\\ntl;dr: My father made my life hell, I cut him off, I found out my step mum has a small chance of living in the next 5 years after speaking to them for the first time in 2 months.","target":"answerable","rationale":"In the anecdote, the author chooses to cut off contact with their father.

Yes, there is a trickle  of biofuel  available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.\\nSecond, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad.

To what extent are Americans really willing to tolerate the environmental influence of domestic  energy production in order to cut back imports?\\nThird, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.\\nThere is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to keep its economy stable.

One muscle, the extensor digitorum communis, is abnormal in most patients with this disease, but to obtain the maximum diagnostic sensitivity, it may be necessary to examine other muscles, especially ones that are more involved clinically. There is no one muscle that will be more abnormal in every patient with MG. The muscle(s) to be tested must be selected based on the distribution of weakness in the individual patient. Abnormal jitter is also seen in diseases of nerve and muscle; these diseases must be excluded by other electrophysiologic and clinical examinations before diagnosing MG. If neuronal or myopathic disease is present, increased jitter does not indicate that MG is also present. However, if jitter is normal in a muscle with definite weakness, the weakness is not due to MG. When abnormal neuromuscular transmission has been demonstrated by repetitive nerve stimulation, the finding of abnormal jitter does not add to the diagnosis, though it may be useful in providing baseline values for comparison with the results of subsequent studies. SFEMG is most valuable clinically in the patient with suspected MG in whom other tests of neuromuscular transmission and antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titers are normal. Serial measurements of jitter can be useful in following the course of disease and in assessing the effect of treatment, but the results from these studies must always be interpreted in light of the overall clinical picture.","target":"Autoantibodies","rationale":"The abstract discusses the diagnosis and monitoring of myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors.

Later on, the paper also mentions that antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titers are normal in patients suspected to have MG. Therefore, it would be helpful if you can identify a keyword related to antibodies or autoimmunity. The answer “Autoantibodies” best describes the focus or contribution of this paper because it highlights one important characteristic of MG and provides useful information for identifying patients with this disease.\\""},{"source":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film begins with June's short narrative prologue about the swan feather in the opening credits and then her farewell surprise party in San Francisco for June's upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China.\\nAmong the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends.

Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies.

Once again, the Raiders started well, driving 58 yards on 12 plays before stalling and settling for a field goal for an early 3-0 lead. Following punts by both team, the Dolphins pass offense carved up the Raiders dinged-up secondary, going 82 yards on 10 play as Jay Cutler hit Damien Williams for a 10-yard touchdown. The extra point hit the upright and the Dolphins led 6-3. The Dolphins attempted an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff which they recovered. Four plays later, inside the Raider 25 yard line, Kenyan Drake fumbled the ball to end the Dolphins' drive. The Raiders quickly answered as Derek Carr hit speedster Johnny Holton on a 44-yard bomb to the end zone to give the Raiders a 10-6 lead with just over three minutes remaining in the half. The Dolphins moved quickly down the field, but were stopped at the Raider 31 and settled for a field goal to reduce the lead to one point. With just over 30 seconds remaining, The Raider offense moved 42 yards on five plays to set up Giorgio Tavecchio's 53-yard field goal as time expired. At the half, the Raiders led 13-9. In the second half, the Raiders forced the Dolphins to punt on their first possession and the Raider offense took over. Moving 67 yards on six plays, Marshawn Lynch capped the drive with a 22-yard touchdown run to push the Raider lead to 20-9. Miami would not give in, answering on their next drive as Cutler hit Jarvis Landry for a six-yard scored to cut the lead to four again. The teams' defenses took over as they each forced a fumble before Ndamukong Suh forced a Carr fumble to give the Dolphins the ball near midfield. However, the Raider defense forced another punt. Following punts from both teams, Oakland took over at their own 13 with 7:21 left in the game. Six plays later, Lynch bowled his way into the end zone from three yards out to appear to put the game away at 27-16 with four and a half minutes remaining. Miami would turn the ball over on downs at midfield with under three minutes remaining as the game again appeared to be over. However, Carr was intercepted on third down and the Phins moved down the field, moving 83 yards and scoring on a 15-yard pass from Cutler to Julius Thomas with 1:32 remaining. The two-point conversion was good as the lead was narrowed to 27-24. Miami's onside kick was recovered by Amari Cooper and the Raiders were able to kneel out the clock for the 27-24 win. Carr threw for 300 yards with a touchdown and interception. Marshawn Lynch scored twice and Jared Cook had a big day with eight receptions for 126 yards. The Raiders were out-gained 395-379 as both teams had over 100 yards in penalties in the sloppy game.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.","target":"Dean","rationale":"The passage states that AM fungi are biotrophic and grow in the presence of plants.

This study was designed to determine whether an impairment in diaphragmatic contractility was involved in the genesis of the diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after upper abdominal surgery. Five patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery were studied. The following measurements were performed before and 4 h after surgery: vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Diaphragmatic function was also assessed using the ratio of changes in gastric pressure (delta Pga) over changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi). Finally contractility of the diaphragm was determined by measuring the change in delta Pdi generated during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves (Pdi stim). Diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in all the patients after upper abdominal surgery as assessed by a marked decrease in delta Pga/delta Pdi from 0.480 +/- 0.040 to -0.097 +/- 0.152 (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery compared with preoperative values. VC also markedly decreased after upper abdominal surgery from 3,900 +/- 630 to 2,060 +/- 520 ml (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after upper abdominal surgery compared with the preoperative values. We conclude that contractility of the diaphragm is not altered after upper abdominal surgery, and diaphragmatic dysfunction is secondary to other mechanisms such as possible reflexes arising from the periphery (chest wall and/or peritoneum), which could inhibit the phrenic nerve output. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Diaphragmatic contractility after upper abdominal surgery. option2: Segmental characterization of defects in collecting tubule acidification.","target":"Diaphragmatic contractility after upper abdominal surgery","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a study that investigated diaphragmatic contractility after upper abdominal surgery and the hypothesis that it may be involved in the genesis of postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.

Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90 percent in the lower Columbia basin.Historic Guild's Lake, in the lower Balch Creek watershed near the Willamette River, was named for Peter Guild (pronounced guile), one of the first European American settlers in the area. In 1847, he acquired nearly 600 acres (2.4 km2) of the watershed through a donation land claim. Although variations in the spelling of Guild's Lake occur in historic newspapers, maps, and other documents, Guild's Lake has been the preferred form since the beginning of the 20th century.The creek is named for Danford Balch, who settled a 346-acre (1.40 km2) donation land claim upstream of the Guild property in 1850. After a man from a neighboring family eloped with a Balch daughter, Balch killed him with a shotgun.

Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the coyote then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.\\nBy the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.","target":"Yellowstone","rationale":"The text explains that wolves were reintroduced into a U.S. National Park in the 1990s as part of efforts to protect and conserve animals, including elk populations which had been significantly reduced after being hunted by wolves.

Sc from 14- and 18-day-old rats were maintained for 13 days in one of the following media: Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-12 (DFM), DFM plus insulin, epidermal growth factor, progesterone, hydrocortisone, and vitamins A and E (6F), 6F plus testosterone (7F), 7F plus FSH (8F), 6F plus 2% fetal bovine serum (6F2S), 6F plus 5% fetal bovine serum (6F5S). The monolayer permeability to [3H]inulin decreased rapidly during the initial 3-5 days of culture for the Sc isolated from 18- and 14-day old animals, then remained stable in all media except DFM. Morphological examination revealed the presence of tight junctions between neighbouring Sc in both age groups, indicating their de novo formation. Secretion of Trf was lowest in DFM and steadily declined. In all other media, Trf secretion peaked on day 5 and remained relatively constant after day 7. Medium 7F only slightly and inconsistently increased the secretion, whereas 8F was always highly stimulatory compared to 6F. Supplementation of 6F with serum resulted in the greatest Trf secretion. In the case of ABP, three different secretion patterns were noted depending on the medium composition; secretion was greatest in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. The medium supplements also differentially affected the polarity of Trf and ABP secretion. The ratio of Trf secreted to the outer and inner compartments (OC/IC) was approximately 2.0 in DFM and was not influenced by supplements in 6F, 7F, and 8F. However, in serum-containing media, the OC/IC ratio gradually increased with time to about 5.0 on day 13. The average OC/IC ratio of ABP was 1.7 in DFM and, in contrast to Trf, declined to 0.7 in other serum-free media. Serum supplementation reversed and increased the ABP ratio to about 6.0 on day 13. These data indicate that Sc grown on permeable supports form confluent monolayers that limit the diffusion of macromolecules, most likely due to the formation of tight junctions. The monolayer permeability as well as the total and polarized secretion of Trf and ABP are differentially regulated by hormones and serum factors.","target":"Bipolar secretion of androgen-binding protein and transferrin by Sertoli cells cultured in a two-compartment culture chamber","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThe title should convey the key focus of the paper.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States.

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. Tom Brady made his 200th career regular season start. On the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route,  and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, Geno Smith hit Jeremy Kerley for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard Oday Aboushi was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from Nick Folk. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7-6. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9-7. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14-12. A crucial pass-interference penalty on Asher Allen on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-12 lead at halftime.  On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with Chris Ivory scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19-17. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20-19 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found Danny Amendola for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27-19. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. Geno Smith engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end Jeff Cumberland for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27-25. Amendola recovered the onside kick, but the Jets defense stepped up, preventing the Patriots from running out the clock, giving the Jets one last chance at an upset with 1:06 remaining. Starting at their own 31, Geno Smith hit David Nelson for 11 yards to the Jets 42. Next, completing a pass to Jeremy Kerley for 13 to the Patriots 45. Chris Ivory ran for five yards before heading out of bounds at the Patriots 40. After an incomplete pass, Folk came on to attempt the game-winning 58-yard field with 0:05 seconds left, but the kick was blocked by defensive lineman Chris Jones, who had been called for a personal foul on a field goal attempt against the Jets the previous season which led to Folk's game winning 42-yard field goal, and the Patriots escaped with their third win in a row. Though not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing  20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end Chandler Jones injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Jets ran for 218 yards on the night, led by Chris Ivory, who continued to be a pest to the Patriots, gaining 107 yards on 21 carries. Chris Johnson added 61 yards on 13 carries.The Jets out-gained the Patriots 423-323 and absolutely controlled the clock winning T.O.P. 40:54-19:06, but the Patriots defense tightened down when it mattered.\\nAnswer this question: How many field goals did Nick Folk have in the first half?","target":"4","rationale":"The Jets' kicker Nick Folk attempted 4 field goals in the first half."},{"source":"In this task, the input is a set of dialogues between a user and an assistant.

His career with the Who spans over 50 years, during which time the band grew to be considered one of the most influential bands of the 20th century. Townshend is the main songwriter for the Who, having written well over 100 songs for the band's 11 studio albums, including concept albums and the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, plus popular rock radio staples such as Who's Next, and dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and tracks on rarities compilations such as Odds & Sods (1974). He has also written more than 100 songs that have appeared on his solo albums, as well as radio jingles and television theme songs.\\nContext: Townshend was born on 19 May 1945, at Chiswick Hospital, Middlesex (now west London). He came from a musical family: his father, Cliff Townshend, was a professional alto saxophonist in the Royal Air Force's dance band The Squadronaires and his mother, Betty (nee Dennis), was a singer with the Sydney Torch and Les Douglass Orchestras. The Townshends had a volatile marriage, as both drank heavily and possessed fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis, whom Pete later described as \\"clinically insane\\". The two-year separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middle-class Acton, and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents.  Townshend says he did not have many friends growing up, so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like Gulliver's Travels and Treasure Island. He enjoyed his family's frequent excursions to the seaside and the Isle of Man. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film Rock Around the Clock, sparking his fascination with American rock and roll. Not long thereafter, he went to see Bill Haley perform in London, Townshend's first concert. At the time, he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician; instead, he wanted to become a journalist.  Upon passing the eleven-plus exam, Townshend was enrolled at Acton County Grammar School. At Acton County, he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught him a couple of chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a short-lived trad jazz group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, and Lonnie Donegan. However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock 'n' roll, with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richard's debut single, \\"Move It\\". Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group's drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a \\"reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar\\" at his mother's antique shop.  Townshend's brothers Paul and Simon were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively. Lacking the requisite test scores to attend university, Pete was faced with the decision of art school, music school, or getting a job. He ultimately chose to study graphic design at Ealing Art College, enrolling in 1961. At Ealing, Townshend studied alongside future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and future Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury. Notable artists and designers gave lectures at the college such as auto-destructive art pioneer Gustav Metzger. Townshend dropped out in 1964 to focus on music full-time.\\nQuestion: did he go to college?.

Persons convicted and sentenced to non-custodial sentences tend not to be described as \\"convicts\\".\\n\\n- A correctional facility, detention center, gaol (Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, UK), jail (US, Canada), penitentiary, prison, or remand centre is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as a form of punishment after being convicted of crimes. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until they are brought to trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. Besides their use for punishing civil crimes, jails and prisons are frequently used by authoritarian regimes.\\n\\n- A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law.

The term \\"crime\\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.

In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at Saint Petersburg University while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908 Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F♯ minor (1903–04), a Symphony in E♭ major (1907), which he catalogued as \\"Opus 1\\", and a short orchestral piece, Feu d'artifice (\\"Fireworks\\", composed in 1908).In 1909 Feu d'artifice was performed at a concert in St. Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences. Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world. In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the Ballets Russes, initially with Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine, the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent. Having heard Feu d'artifice he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create the ballet Les Sylphides.

In that filing, PepsiCo pleaded with the SEC to reject the Shareholder’s Resolution filed in October 2011 that the company “adopt a corporate policy that recognizes human rights and employs ethical standards which do not involve using the remains of aborted human beings in both private and collaborative research and development agreements.”The group again called for a boycott of companies that had partnered with Senomyx.The original claim that Senomyx had used HEK293 to test its products is true, but thanks to anti-abortion groups enabled by some Christian media outlets, the original claim has morphed over the years. Today, viral emails and blogs claim that cells from aborted babies are used as ingredients, which is completely false.The HEK293 cell line dates back to the 1970s. Today, it is commonly used to test new drugs and vaccines:The cells, called HEK 293 cells (that stands for human embryonic kidney) were taken from an aborted fetus in the 1970s in the Netherlands. Bits of chopped up DNA from the adenovirus, a virus that causes a pretty severe cold. The kidney cells were forced to take up bits of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 that used a calcium solution. The resulting cells don’t act much like human cells at all, but they are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. That’s why they’re used in the development of drugs and vaccines. No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isn’t leading to new abortions.In 2008, Senomyx was awarded a patent on “recombinant methods for expressing a function sweet taste receptor” that lists the cells as part of the process, and according to 2011 reports, many of the company’s 77 patents listed HEK293.While it appears to be true that these cells are used to develop and test new ingredients, the claim that the cells themselves are used for ingredients is false and based on a fundamental misunderstanding of scientific research and development and how it works.Iteration: Adrenochrome (“Adenochrome”) and fetal tissue harvestingRumors about cells from aborted fetuses in commercial products like Pepsi re-circulated after the January 22 2019 passage of new abortion-related laws in New York State, and those long-circulating claims merged with a related rumor involving a substance known as “adrenochrome” (often misspelled as “adenochrome”).Users of 4Chan’s /pol/ board were among proponents of the claim, evidenced in a February 2 2019 post titled “FUCK: Was the recent abortion law pushed to produce enough adrenochrome for RBG to survive? ?” Variations of the rumor also appeared on Instagram (archived here):Adrenochrome is a byproduct of the oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). It has long been thought to be a powerful recreational drug due to its mention in Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the substance described in the book was intended to be fictional and its resemblance to an extant substance was accidental. Thompson’s reference to the substance as a drug appears to have driven the pop culture belief that it was both rare and powerful, but by and large, information around adrenochrome (regarldess of how it is purportedly harvested) is believed to be a myth. Claim: \\"Fetal cells from abortions are being used to flavor commercial foods and drinks or in the production of a mysterious substance known as \\"\\"adrenochrome.\\"","target":"0","rationale":"The paragraph provides a factual account of how some Christian media outlets have confused the public on the original claim that Senomyx had used HEK293 to test its products.

Magellan sailed from Seville in August, 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the cold winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel which is now called Magellan Strait . In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America.\\nThey then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville three years after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition. However, their achievement was great. They were the first men to sail round the world.\\nQuestion: The best title for this passage is    _   .\\nOptions: A: The Discovery of Magellan's Strait\\nB: The Discovery of the Philippines\\nC: The Most Dangerous Expedition\\nD: The First Expedition to Asia","target":"D","rationale":"The passage is about a group of explorers who sailed from Europe to Asia by going around South America.

Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924.\\nContext: During the 1890s, Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was \\"very sick at heart over music\\" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: \\"A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come.\\"  In 1899, that prediction suddenly came true. At the age of forty-two, Elgar produced the Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, \\"I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... that is to say I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I think they would have written - if they were asses enough to compose\\". He dedicated the work \\"To my friends pictured within\\". Probably the best known variation is \\"Nimrod\\", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.  The work is formally titled Variations on an Original Theme; the word \\"Enigma\\" appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of the title. The enigma is that, although there are fourteen variations on the \\"original theme\\", there is another overarching theme, never identified by Elgar, which he said \\"runs through and over the whole set\\" but is never heard. Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of Richard Strauss. The Enigma Variations were well received in Germany and Italy, and remain to the present day a worldwide concert staple.\\nQuestion: what pieces did he compose?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"works for the great choral festivals","rationale":"The context states that Elgar composed works for the great choral festivals."},{"source":"Q: What are the only organelles that prokaryotic cells have?\\n\\n\\nRead this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:\\n\\nEukaryotic cells have other organelles besides the nucleus.

Seven patients have been lost to follow-up but none is recorded as dead (National Registry of Deaths) at least 5 years after operation. Fifteen patients (16.5%) have died, four from cerebral and eight from cardiac causes. Three patients had cerebral infarction with permanent deficits, one occurring immediately after operation, one at 3 months, and one at 9 years. Four patients had minor strokes but a full clinical recovery, three patients postoperatively and one patient at 4 years. Fourteen patients had ipsilateral TIAs, four occurred postoperatively and 10 occurred from 1 to 8 years later. Ten patients had contralateral TIAs and five patients then had a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Another nine patients also had bilateral operations, three for bilateral TIAs, five as prophylactic procedures on the basis of arteriographic findings, and one for a contralateral cerebral event that occurred after arteriography. Thus, at the mean follow-up time (5.5 years) and including the operative complications, four deaths (4%) of cerebral origin and seven serious cerebral problems (7%) have occurred--an annual morbidity and mortality rate of less than 2%. This compares favorably with the commonly predicted rate of stroke occurring after TIAs of 5% per year. These figures support the argument that carotid endarterectomy reduces the incidence of stroke occurring after TIA and stops TIAs caused by emboli from the carotid bifurcation.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that investigated the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in preventing strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) by examining patient outcomes after CEA.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome.

The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice.

While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013.\\n\\nKrauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a \\"mistake\\" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination.  On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published \\"Miers: The Only Exit Strategy\\", in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: \\"Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives.\\" Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument: \\"As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great Nation. Repeatedly in the course of the process of confirmation for nominees for other positions, I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the Executive Branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process. I feel compelled to adhere to this position, especially related to my own nomination. Protection of the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and continued pursuit of my confirmation are in tension. I have decided that seeking my confirmation should yield.\\"  The same day, NPR noted, \\"Krauthammer's scenario played out almost exactly as he wrote.\\" Columnist E.J. Dionne wrote that the White House was following Krauthammer's strategy \\"almost to the letter\\". A few weeks later, the New York Times reported that Krauthammer's \\"exit strategy\\" was \\"exactly what happened,\\" and that Krauthammer \\"had no prior inkling from the administration that they were taking that route; he has subsequently gotten credit for giving [the Bush administration] a plan.\\"\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Charles Krauthammer","rationale":"All the text is centered around Charles Krauthammer, and what he did.\\nThe answer therefore obviously seems to be: \\nCharles Krauthammer"},{"source":"Fossils may form in other ways.

In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.","target":"Arpád Sándor","rationale":"The answer is Arpád Sándor.\\nIn the passage it mentions that Ferrier's accompanist was suffering from a depressive illness and her fury about this once she finds out.
