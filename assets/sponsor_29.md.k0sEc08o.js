The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season. This would mark Urlacher's final game in a Bears' uniform. Urlacher was inactive for the final four games of the 2012 season, and he retired from the NFL on May 22, 2013.\\n\\nQuestion: How many yards did Seattle have in the entire game?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"459","rationale":"The answer of \\"How many yards did Seattle have in the entire game?\\" is 459, which are given by Chicago Bears defense."},{"source":"Given a statement and question, generate the answer to the question such that the answer is contained in the statement.\\n\\nstatement: genitaliaare used in reproduction, question: What are genitalia used in?","target":"reproduction","rationale":"The answer \\"reproduction\\" is contained in the statement."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true.

He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany.\\n\\nA notable thesis propagated by Trevor-Roper was the \\"general crisis of the 17th century\\". He argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by demographic, social, religious, economic and political problems. In this \\"general crisis,\\" various events, such as the English Civil War, the Fronde in France, the climax of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, troubles in the Netherlands, and revolts against the Spanish Crown in Portugal, Naples and Catalonia, were all manifestations of the same problems. The most important causes of the \\"general crisis\\" in Trevor-Roper's opinion were conflicts between \\"Court\\" and \\"Country\\"; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states, represented by the Court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry, representing the country. In addition, he said that the religious and intellectual changes introduced by the Reformation and the Renaissance were important secondary causes of the \\"general crisis.\\"  The \\"general crisis\\" thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory, and those, such as the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, who agreed with him that there was a \\"general crisis,\\" but saw the problems of 17th century Europe as more economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow. A third faction denied that there was any \\"general crisis,\\" for example the Dutch historian Ivo Schoffer, the Danish historian Niels Steengsgaard, and the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya. Trevor-Roper's \\"general crisis\\" thesis provoked much discussion, and led experts in 17th century history such as Roland Mousnier, J. H. Elliott, Lawrence Stone, E. H. Kossmann, Eric Hobsbawm and J. H. Hexter to become advocates of the pros and cons of the theory.  At times the discussion became quite heated; the Italian Marxist historian Rosario Villari, speaking of the work of Trevor-Roper and Mousnier, claimed that: \\"The hypothesis of imbalance between bureaucratic expansion and the needs of the state is too vague to be plausible, and rests on inflated rhetoric, typical of a certain type of political conservative, rather than on effective analysis.\\" Villari accused Trevor-Roper of downgrading the importance of what Villari called the English Revolution (the usual Marxist term for the English Civil War), and insisted that the \\"general crisis\\" was part of a Europe-wide revolutionary movement. Another Marxist critic of Trevor-Roper the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya attacked the concept of a conflict between \\"Court\\" and \\"Country\\" as fiction, arguing there was no \\"general crisis;\\" instead she maintained that the so-called \\"general crisis\\" was merely the emergence of capitalism.\\n\\nIs there anything else important?","target":"Trevor-Roper's \\"general crisis\\" thesis provoked much discussion, and led experts in 17th century history","rationale":"For the given context, the answer is :\\nTrevor-Roper's \\"general crisis\\" thesis provoked much discussion, and led experts in 17th century history"},{"source":"I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two groups of scientists examined two fires.

For the most part everything is good, she's a very kind and loving person, and in most aspects I'm happy with the relationship. However, there are a few issues, the most prominent of which is the fact that we haven't had sex in the five months that we've been together (Or the month or two that we had been dating.) \\n\\nWe've gotten close once towards the beginning of the relationship. Sparing the details, during foreplay she told a joke that we both laughed at for a while, and as the laughter died down she mentioned that it killed her mood, and we could pick up where we left off another time. So, we stopped. It was no big deal, sometimes you're just not in the mood. \\n\\nAfterwards though any time she started to flirt with me heavily and I would respond in kind, she would respond with something along the lines of 'Hard pass' or 'Down boy,' because 'she's just teasing.' Being rejected so frequently and exclusively is doing a number on my self esteem, and the constant teasing is leaving me pretty frustrated. Strangely, she's frequently mentioned how 'healthy' our sex life is to our mutual friends.\\n\\nNow, I'm someone who has a high sex drive when I'm in a relationship, and I really need physical intimacy. A decent part of a relationship to me is the feeling of being wanted, and expressing your want for your partner.  I've tried talking to her about it a few times trying to figure out her reason for never wanting to get intimate in case it's something that we can work on, but she has yet to give me a reason beyond just 'not being in the mood.'\\n\\nConsidering everything else in the relationship is very good I feel like it would be extremely shallow of me to break up with her over sex.

When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases, precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneous, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.","target":"precipitation hardening alloys","rationale":"The question asks what type of alloy gets harder as it ages. The context mentions \\n\\"precipitation hardening alloys\\". It says that these alloys tend to become much softer than normal when they are heated and then cooled quickly, but over time (as they age) the intermetallic phases can form precipitates which make them hard. So this is an example of a type of alloy that becomes harder with age because intermetallic compounds begin forming within its crystal structure after cooling from a high temperature state where most solutes have dissolved into solution. From this we know that precipitation hardening alloys get harder as they get older."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

His parents had three children, of which Gurney was the middle: (1) Evelyn Gurney Miller (b. 1929), (2) Albert Ramsdell Gurney, Jr. (b. 1930), and (3) Stephen S. Gurney (b. 1933).\\n\\nIn 1959, following graduation from Yale, Gurney taught English and Latin at a day school, Belmont Hill School, in Belmont, Massachusetts for one year. He then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of humanities (1960-96) and professor of literature (1970-96).  He began writing plays such as Children and The Middle Ages while at MIT, but it was his great success with The Dining Room that allowed him to write full-time. After The Dining Room, Gurney wrote a number of plays, most of them concerning WASPs of the American northeast. While at Yale, Gurney also wrote Love in Buffalo, the first musical ever produced at the Yale School of Drama. Since then, he is known to be a prolific writer, always writing something.  His first play in New York, which ran for just one performance in October 1968, The David Show, premiered at the Players' Theater on MacDougal Street. The play was cut after its first show by sneers from the entire press except for two enthusiasts, Edith Oliver in The New Yorker and another from the Village Voice.  His 2015 play, Love and Money, is about a mature woman making plans to dispose of her fortune, and the twists that ensue. The world premiere was at New York's Signature Theatre in August 2015. Before that, The Grand Manner, a play about his real life encounter with famed actress Katharine Cornell in her production of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, was produced and performed by Lincoln Center for the summer of 2010.

I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’.\\nWe separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...","target":"Beiderbecke","rationale":"The article mentions that Beiderbecke was involved in the development of a talking picture, The King of Jazz.

Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:  Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.  Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\".  Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \\"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\\".\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"What did he teach about human development?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\".","rationale":"Vivekananda believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse.

Children over age 6 can suck on hard candy (butterscotch seems to be a soothing flavor) or lollipops. Children over 8 years old can also gargle with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt per glass). Most sore throats are caused by viruses and are part of a cold. About 10% of sore throats are caused by strep bacteria. Tonsillitis (temporary swelling and redness of the tonsils) usually occurs with any throat infection, viral or bacterial. Swollen tonsils do not have any special meaning. In adults, Group B strep can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections, pneumoniaand, rarely, meningitis, according to the CDC. Strep bacteria can also cause inflammation of the kidneys. Called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, the condition can occur one to two weeks after a strep throat infection. One indication of this type of inflammation is rust-colored urine. Symptoms. Symptoms of strep throat typically appear several days after exposure to the bacteria. The most common symptom of a strep infection is a sore throat. Irritants such as smoke in the air can also make you feel raw. Strep throat is different -- it’s caused by bacteria. You need to know whether you or your child has strep or another illness so you can get the right treatment. How Do I Catch It? Strep throat is an infection of the throat and tonsils. Bacteria called group Astreptococcus cause it. They live in the nose and throat. You can get the infection from someone who is sick with strep A bacteria or is a carrier of it. Like other infections, it spreads through close contact. Strep throat can leave you feeling sore and scratchy. Learn what causes this infection and how to tell strep from other sore throat causes. Two types of bacteria can cause strep throat: Group A (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) and Group B. Each strain of bacteria can result in different complications. Strep bacteria are very contagious, and spread by nasal secretions and saliva. Strep throat most often afflicts children younger than 16, according to the Mayo Clinic. Strep throat itself is not particularly dangerous but the infection can worsen, especially if it goes untreated. If strep throat does not improve within two days of beginning treatment, it could indicate the presence of another infection, the spread of strep to other areas outside the throat, or an inflammatory reaction. Strep bacteria may infect the tonsils and sinuses if left untreated. The Strep test is not urgent, however, since treating a strep infection within 7 days of when it begins can prevent rheumatic fever. A Strep test is not necessary if your child's sore throat is part of a cold AND the main symptom is croup, hoarseness, or a cough, unless the sore throat lasts more than 5 days. If your child has strep throat, streptococci bacteria will grow in it. It usually takes about 2 days to get results from a throat culture. It can confirm whether your child has strep throat or not. Treatments. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. Most treatments last for about 10 days. Some people suffering from strep throat will also get swollen lymph glands in their neck. Others experience vomiting or a red skin rash. How Long Does Strep Throat Last? Strep throat will only last 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Doctors usually treat strep throat with antibiotics even though they will not make you well any faster. Strep throat contagiousness will continue for 24 hours once antibiotics are started. With no treatment, strep throat continues to be contagious until symptoms resolve.

He replaced the retiring Liberal member, Arthur Marshall. Hames was included in the shadow cabinet immediately after the election, and went on to serve under four leaders of the opposition (Matt Birney, Paul Omodei, Troy Buswell, and Colin Barnett). He was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in January 2008, when Buswell became leader, and retained the deputy leadership when Buswell was replaced by Barnett later in the year. The Liberal Party formed government after the 2008 state election, with Hames becoming Deputy Premier, Minister for Health, and Minister for Indigenous Affairs (for a second time) in the new ministry. In December 2010, he was also appointed Minister for Tourism. However, Hames resigned as tourism minister in July 2013, after being accused of abusing an accommodation entitlement.

In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo  becomes an icon across the Soviet Union when he is photographed planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag during the Battle of Berlin. He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union.\\nIn 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev; all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin, is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views. Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife.\\nMeanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora, is found dead near a railway yard. Although the initial pathology report shows injuries consistent with torture, the surgically precise removal of organs, and drowning, the authorities declare that he was hit by a train, as Stalin has decreed that murder is a capitalist disease; there is no murder in a communist paradise.

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?'

The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control it, at Milan. Milan was named as the place, here three hundred bishops assembled, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of Dionysius (bishop of Milan), and the two Papal Legates, viz., Eusebius of Vercelli and Lucifer of Cagliari, consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius.

Humans use this ability to quickly solve a  task instance, and to bootstrap learning of new tasks. Achieving these abilities in autonomous agents is an open problem. In this paper, we introduce an off-policy RL algorithm (MetaMimic) to narrow this gap. MetaMimic can learn both (i) policies for high-fidelity one-shot imitation of diverse novel skills, and (ii) policies that enable the agent to solve tasks more efficiently than the demonstrators. MetaMimic relies on the principle of storing all experiences in a memory and replaying these to learn massive deep neural network policies by off-policy RL. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the largest existing neural networks for deep RL and shows that larger networks with normalization are needed to achieve one-shot high-fidelity imitation on a challenging manipulation task.\\n The results also show that both types of policy can be learned from vision, in spite of the task rewards being sparse, and without access to demonstrator actions.","target":"We present MetaMimic, an algorithm that takes as input a demonstration dataset and outputs (i) a one-shot high-fidelity imitation policy (ii) an unconditional task policy","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe present MetaMimic, an algorithm that takes as input a demonstration dataset and outputs (i) a one-shot high-fidelity imitation policy (ii) an unconditional task policy."},{"source":"In this task you will be given a list of strings and you need to concatenate them.\\n\\n['stayed', 'G', 'T', 'and', 'p', 'R', 'course', 'y', 'B', 'course', 'c', 'T']","target":"stayedGTandpRcourseyBcoursecT","rationale":"The strings in the given list need to be concatenated.

His father, Francois Baudelaire, a senior civil servant and amateur artist, was 34 years older than Baudelaire's mother, Caroline. Francois died during Baudelaire's childhood, in 1827. The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts.\\n\\nBaudelaire next worked on a translation and adaptation of Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater. Other works in the years that followed included Petits Poemes en prose (Small Prose poems); a series of art reviews published in the Pays, Exposition universelle (Country, World Fair); studies on Gustave Flaubert (in L'Artiste, October 18, 1857); on Theophile Gautier (Revue contemporaine, September 1858); various articles contributed to Eugene Crepet's Poetes francais; Les Paradis artificiels: opium et haschisch (French poets; Artificial Paradises: opium and hashish) (1860); and Un Dernier Chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de Balzac (A Final Chapter of the history of works of Balzac) (1880), originally an article \\"Comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du genie\\" (\\"How one pays one's debts when one has genius\\"), in which his criticism turns against his friends Honore de Balzac, Theophile Gautier, and Gerard de Nerval.  By 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of laudanum, his life of stress, and his poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at Honfleur. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem Le Voyage being one example of his efforts during that time. In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of Richard Wagner.  His financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the rights to his works and also to give lectures. His long-standing relationship with Jeanne Duval continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan Apollonie Sabatier, though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked opium, and in Brussels he began to drink to excess. Baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and paralysis followed. After more than a year of aphasia, he received the last rites of the Catholic Church. The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in \\"maisons de sante\\" in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the Cimetiere du Montparnasse, Paris.  Many of Baudelaire's works were published posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and at last she found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. \\"I see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature.\\" She lived another four years.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Charles Baudelaire","rationale":"This passage is about the life of Charles Baudelaire.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money.

He serves as associate chief of the neurosurgery service at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, and as assistant professor of neurosurgery at the Emory University School of Medicine. A media personality on health-related issues, he is best known as CNN's multiple Emmy Award-winning chief medical correspondent, hosting the network's weekend health program Sanjay Gupta, M.D., and making frequent appearances on their American Morning, Larry King Live and Anderson Cooper 360deg programs. His reports from Charity Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina led to him winning a 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Feature Story in a Regularly Scheduled Newscast.\\n\\nOn January 6, 2009, CNN announced that Gupta had been considered for the position of Surgeon General by President Barack Obama.  Some doctors said that his communication skills and high profile would allow him to highlight medical issues and prioritize medical reform. However, others raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest with drug companies who have sponsored his broadcasts and his lack of skepticism in weighing the costs and benefits of medical treatments.  Representative John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), wrote a letter opposing Gupta's nomination. Conyers supports a single-payer health care system, the sort that Conyers' filmmaker friend Michael Moore advocated in his documentary Sicko; Gupta has criticized Moore and the film.  Others, such as liberal commentator Jane Hamsher, defended the appointment, noting that Gupta's responsibilities as a surgeon general would be not that different from those of his CNN position, and that Gupta's media presence would make him ideal for the position. From the medical community, Donna Wright, of Creative Health Care Management, a regular commentator on medicine and politics, also defended the appointment on the grounds of his media presence, combined with his medical qualifications, which she viewed as an ideal combination for the post of surgeon general. Likewise, Fred Sanfilippo, executive vice president for health affairs at Emory University, supported Gupta's nomination by issuing a press release saying: \\"He has the character, training, intelligence and communications skills needed to help the United States improve its health and health care delivery systems in the next Administration.\\" The American Council on Exercise, listed by PR Newswire as \\"America's leading authority on fitness and one of the largest fitness certification, education and training organizations in the world\\", endorsed the nomination of Gupta \\"because of his passion for inspiring Americans to lead healthier, more active lives\\". The ACE sent a letter of support to senator Edward M. Kennedy. Former surgeon general Joycelyn Elders also supported Gupta's nomination, saying: \\"He has enough well-trained, well-qualified public health people to teach him the things he needs to do the job.\\" In March 2009 Gupta withdrew his name from consideration for the post, citing his family and his career.

History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing \\"perspective\\" on the problems of the present. Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources, are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the \\"disinterested investigation\\" required of the discipline of history.","target":"What comic strip is in the [History] genre?","rationale":"The new question must be asking the exact same thing as the original question does.

His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the Ahlström-Gullichsen family. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. His furniture designs were considered Scandinavian Modern. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a \\"total work of art\\"; whereby he  together with his first wife Aino Aalto  would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware.

I decided to take a job offer with better pay and worse hours (80+ hours a week) so my husband could stay home and study for his CDL. He claimed to want a more stable career. \\n\\nThis continues for several months until I completely burn myself out trying to manage the kids (4) and the household while working so much. My husband decided to start looking for a job again, putting a pin in the CDL goal. He found a job that took him away from home for 3-4 months at a time working in agricultural construction this past spring. While he was gone I decided to go back to college online. \\n\\nHe worked there for four months before he **intentionally** got fired (he told me this). During this time he was striking up conversations with an ex, who has been a continuous dark cloud over our relationship because of my own insecurities. He then comes back to Indiana and tells his father I said he wasn’t allowed back home because he didn’t have a job (I never said these words and I didn’t know he was coming back home until after he’d already returned to the state.) \\n\\nHis father gives him an under-the-table job two hours away from our home, so my husband has been staying with his dad and his uncle for the last six months. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have been trying to get a handle on our money because I am hoping to go to law school and my credit report doesn’t look so great. I started working on a budget this afternoon and four hours later I had all the finances in one place. While my husband and I were texting about our days, I sent him a photo of what I’d done for the day. He makes an inaccurate comment about how we would have “$500 left over a month.” \\n\\nI explain to him we wouldn’t have any left-overs anymore because I was doing a zero-based budget. I joke that I didn’t think he would read everything so closely and he shuts down for a moment. He then goes into it, telling me how he needs to pay his dad back for all the charity and is upset I didn’t consult with him. \\n\\nI try explaining to him these numbers were based on whether or not my ex-husband would pay his child support payments on time every week (which he hasn’t done for 11 years, but they started up again recently). He then takes offense that I used his name and ends the conversation before “it leads to a stupid ass argumentative tone that ends up with us getting nasty with each other”. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI wasn’t finished explaining the budget but he wanted to end the conversation without letting me explain. So I messaged him anyway. He goes off, implying I think he should screw over his father and telling me “it’s nice you can write the whole budget without even asking if I have any debts I need to settle”. (Him not being considerate of me has been an ongoing issue in our relationship – including him disappearing for hours into the early morning with his friend to get high and not calling me – and it has never been a problem for the past three years that I’ve managed the finances without “consulting” him.)\\n\\nI threw my hands up. I’m functioning as a single mother of four, in college full-time, one of my children has ODD/ADD and I’m driving back and forth to the school twice a week for a problem, my kids have 2-3 out of school activities a piece, I’m the only one cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, paying the bills, dealing with household problems.\\n\\nI acknowledge on a weekly basis how much it means to me that my husband works so hard and keeps a steady income so we can pay for necessities. I give him massages every time I see him because he’s in manual labor. I do not feel like I downplay what he does at all. I do not receive the same acknowledgment.\\n\\nI told him he could hand the finances, then, and he agreed. I gave him every password to every account.  He states we’re going to have a surplus of cash because he didn’t know what half the accounts were (I only sent him our utilities, two credit cards we don’t use, the internet log in, our car insurance, and our debt consolidation payment). He then tells me the bills will just “have to wait” until he has better internet service. \\n\\nI tell him I would take that as a sign of being apathetic to the needs of his family. I told him “since I’ve been doing such a shitty job handling the finances, there’s no reason for money to continue to touch my hands”. He claims I put words in his mouth and then said “fuck you” to me. I told him he didn’t say it, but he implied it. I wrote down a nicer way he could have asked. \\n\\nHe tells me I blew shit out of proportion “in a feminine manner” and that I “make \\\\[him\\\\] look like a dumbass”. (There were just the two of us texting???) I asked him if he thought my opinions, thoughts, words, and ideas don’t matter because I have a vagina.\\n\\nHe exact words were “Well, if the stereotypical shoe fits, makeover them Pradas”. (I don’t even know what this means, the most expensive pair of shoes I own I got on clearance for less than $30.) At this point, I stop responding to him because it’s not getting anywhere and he’s being ridiculous.\\n\\nAfterward, he called me on the phone and demanded my email account information. I told him I didn’t want to give it to him and told him it was not because I have anything to hide, but because of the nasty way, he demanded it. He told me to shut the fuck up. I hung up on him. \\n\\nHe called back and asked if I was done being a bitch. I hung up again. \\n\\nHe called back and started screaming at me. At one point he accused me of thinking I’m always right about everything (which is completely untrue and I’ve, on more than just one occasion, admitted to being wrong/defeated, and I’m not a spoiled sport about it). I told him he was being disrespectful by calling me names and telling me to “shut up”. I said I wanted a divorce and that I didn’t want a partner who couldn’t be mad without disrespecting me. He mocked me and told me he wouldn’t sign papers.\\n\\nI told him I didn’t need his signature and that the courts grant contested divorces.

In addition, relapse frequently occurs after application of conventional chemotherapy in CLL. Recently several new chemo-free treatment options have been introduced within clinical trials. Among them are monoclonal antibodies, most of them targeting the CD20 molecule: besides the licensed drugs rituximab and ofatumumab obinutuzumab, although in combination with chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment of elderly patients with CLL. Lenalidomide as monotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed disease and first data within clinical trials have been generated in the front-line setting. A promising class of novel agents has been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL are the BH3-mimetic inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins. Other interesting candidate drugs that are currently explored for CLL patients include small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) proteins (e. g. TRU-016), CDK inhibitors (e. g. dinaciclib), HDAC inhibitors and others. Given all these novel agents and targets, chemo-free or at least chemo-reduced concepts may become reality in the near future for our patients suffering from CLL. \\n Question: What is the name of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?","target":"ibrutinib","rationale":"The question asks for the name of a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

When only an approximate pH value is needed, an inexpensive test involves the use of acid-base indicators , which change color based on the relative acidity of the solution. One type of common indicator is litmus paper. For example, if a piece of litmus paper is dipped into an acidic solution (pH below ~4.5), it will turn red, and dipping it into a basic solution (pH above ~8.5) will turn it blue. Solutions of intermediate pH will result in various shades of purple. Because different indicators change color at different pH values, the use of multiple indicators can generally narrow down the possible pH of a solution to a range of about 0.5-1 pH units.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated.

POST : This probably gonna be a long one, sorry in advance.\\n\\nI have a friend who I used to be close to when we were younger. Ever since, he has progressively gotten worse with his problems. He has a pretty bad drug problem and uses marijuana so much that it has become a crutch. (I don’t mind casual smoking but it becomes harmful when it gets to a point) \\n\\nHe has always tried to come visit to be with my family and I have had a hard time saying no because there is no nice way to do it. Most times, he will just book flights with out making sure its ok and then we are stuck with him. Every year, however, I see him over the summer and he always seems to be a different person. He’s one of those people that has never found their own true personality and is often fake in his interactions with others. \\n\\nThis year, he has become almost obsessive about his “spirituality”. He’s been here for only a few days and so far its been all he can talk about. The strangest thing being I saw him only a few months ago and he told me he had completely stopped believing in god. Now, he is a very, very serious christian. It doesn’t help that my whole family is pretty much atheist. \\n\\nTo be clear, it’s not the christianity part that bothers me. I have christian friends and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. However, it’s annoying when you feel like someone is constantly trying to push their religious beliefs on you and your whole family. \\n\\nBut thats not it. I don’t think he’s really christian once he went into detail about it (unsolicited). His ideas he has aren’t any type of christian i have ever heard of before. It started at first when he told me that god had spoke to him and given him a prophecy. At first I thought he was joking but he read his entire prophecy to me about all kinds of strange things that I couldn’t follow. He was saying that WW3 was going to happen and that Israel and America would rise to be world superpowers? Also something about how we would have a world government and we would get our energy from Venus.\\n\\nNot only that, but he also told one of my relatives that he has a girl inside his head talking to him. The girl was talking to him at that moment and that he wasn’t supposed to be telling anyone this. \\n\\nHe constantly preaches about how he believes in 3 different types of “eyes” (like a third eye). He drew a whole diagram of them for me and explained how god was always talking to him and giving him definitive answers. At first, I tried to discuss with him about it and try to be open minded. The longer we talked, however, I couldn’t keep my cool as he always would argue back that Jesus was in his heart and helping him to try to be a better person. He always used that argument regardless of what point I was trying to argue. \\n\\nAlso he said he would believe in this forever, he could now get vibes from others (literally just called empathy every one has it), and that doing drugs lets him see more. I couldn’t take it anymore and I started to call him ridiculous and obsessive. I told him it made absolutely no sense for god to tell him a prophecy. To be blunt, he wasn’t happy I said any of that and said I was making fun of his religious beliefs. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning whether or not they were wrong for \\"going off\\" on their friend after he told them a prophecy that God had given him.\\\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe their interactions with their friend, which suggests that these events have already occurred.\\\\nBased on the above analysis, it seems that this post is not hypothetical and describes events that have already occurred.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a $10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder $6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't.

The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.\\n\\n- Christian Falster ( January 1 , 1690 -- October 24 , 1752 ) was a Danish poet and philologist , born at Branderslev ( island of Laaland ) .

He published translations of Ovid ( 1719 ) and the Satires of Juvenal ( 1731 ) ; 11 original satires on his times , often reprinted ( 1720 -- 39 ) ; and in Latin a number of works , such as Viglia Prima Noctium Ripensiun ( 1721 ) ; Memoriœ Obscurœ ( 1722 ) ; Amœnitates Philologicœ ( three volumes , 1821 -- 32 ) . The editors of The Classical Journal wrote that : Falster thought that all learning should be brought to bear upon theology , and , like Erasmus , he though ( sic ) that classical authors could contribute much toward sound religion .

I have just ordered a new prescription. According to the instructions, I will need 4 drops per day. 1 drop each for the small toes and 2 drops for the large toe. I have found that the 4 ml bottle runs out of medicine after three weeks. I am getting about 80 drops out of each bottle, but the pharmacy says there should be 200 drops per bottle. I am not getting close to 200. There is no information provided with the prescription as to how many doses are in each bottle.

Here’s the link to where I will be purchasing my second bottle of Apetamin. THIS is what your bottle should look like. The product will not be filled to the top. So you’re probably asking, what is Apetamin? It’s a vitamin syrup that works to enhance your appetite. For me in particular this was key because I have a very weak appetite. I’m talking I could literally eat once a day, with one little bottle of something to drink to help wash it down. Totally unhealthy, and not helpful to gaining weight. In fact, this habit is what helped me lose weight. Taking just 10ml of the apetamin syrup 3x before meals enabled me to eat an entire plate and still have room for more. The weight gain wasted no time following the new habit. My weight prior to starting the apetamin was 128.5lbs, 5 days into taking it I weighed 134.3lbs. That’s 6lbs in 5 days!!! Unbelievable, I know. One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately one week. The sleepiness or drowsiness usually occurs the first few days of taking Apetamin and will decrease thereafter. The Manufacturer's recommended adult dosage of Apetamin syrup is 10-15mL three times a day, take 10 to 30 minutes before meals. Does Apetamin make you sleepy? Yes, Apetamin can cause sleepiness or drowsiness for the first few days. If you stop using it and start up again you will most likely be sleepy again the first few days. Besides that if you use it regularly it will not effect your sleep schedule. How long does one (1) bottle last? One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately 7-10 Days, we suggest ordering your next bottle when your current bottle is at it’s half way point. Do I need to refrigerate Apetamin? It is recommended that Apetamin be stored at a temperature to be protected from sunlight & UV rays. A cool dark cabinet or draw is fine but it can stay in room temperature after opening for up to 2 weeks (if your taking your Apetamin correctly it should only last for a week [7-10 days]) Will I lose weight if I ... You will use approx. 1 bottle per week if you have two big toes and 5 small toes infected. Less if all toes are affected. I wrote a complaint to the review board of my insurance company and they filled my prescription to meet the 1 bottle per week need. Fast Acting Apetamin’s fast acting formula will have you seeing results in as little as 1 week. How soon should I see results? Apetamin will increase your appetite in just 2 days. You will start gaining in one week. Can I take if I’m breastfeeding or pregnant? No, Apetamin can’t be taken if pregnant or breast feeding. Please consult with your physician regarding any medical questions. Does Apetamin syrup need to be refrigerated? No, please store in a dark, cool place. Preferably a cabinet.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society.

The High Court of Justice in Ireland  ruled on 31 July 1923 that a state of war no longer existed, and consequently the internment of republicans, permitted under common law only in wartime, was now illegal. Without a formal peace, holding 13,000 prisoners and worried that fighting could break out again at any time, the government enacted two Public Safety  Acts on 1 and 3 August 1923, to permit continued internment and other measures. Thousands of Anti-Treaty IRA members  were arrested by the Free State forces in the weeks and months after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home. On 27 August 1923, a general election was held, which Cumann na nGaedheal, the pro-Free State party, won with about 40% of the first-preference vote. The Republicans, represented by Sinn Féin, won about 27% of the vote. Many of their candidates and supporters were still imprisoned before, during and after the election. In October 1923, around 8,000 of the 12,000 Republican prisoners in Free State gaols went on a hunger strike. The strike lasted for 41 days and met little success .

Passage 1:Fearing that his self-proclaimed sex appeal with women was being threatened by Morton, NWA Champion Ric Flair began a feud with Morton in 1986. In the spring of that year, Morton was having an interview at ringside when Flair came onto the set and insulted Morton's fans (who consisted mostly of tween girls) by calling them \\"teenyboppers in their training bras.\\" He gave Morton a training bra as a \\"gift from one of Flair's girlfriends\\" and told Morton that he couldn't handle real, grown-up women. In response, Morton stomped on Flair's sunglasses. This led to a fight and then a series of matches, the most notable being their Steel Cage match at the 1986 Great American Bash. To help build Morton as a serious title contender, it was pointed out that he once went to a one-hour draw with then-AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel. Morton never won the title but he proved that he was of the same caliber as Flair was in the ring. At one point in the feud with Flair, after a six-man tag team elimination match in which Morton pinned Flair to become the winner, Flair and the other three Four Horsemen invaded the Rock 'n' Roll Express' dressing room and attacked Morton, rubbing his face on the concrete floor, causing a grotesque-looking facial injury. They also broke his nose in another attack. Horsemen member Arn Anderson would also make fun of Morton, calling him \\"Punky Morton,\\" which was a play on the popular 1980s sitcom Punky Brewster. The term used to belittle Morton backfired when fans began to use it as a term of endearment. Morton and Gibson won the title back from the Midnight Express and feuded with Ole and Arn Anderson for the rest of the year. They culminated this feud with a win over the Andersons in a cage match at Starrcade on November 28. This victory started the Horsemen's dissatisfaction with Ole, who was kicked out of the stable just months later. Morton and Gibson then lost the title to Rick Rude and Manny Fernandez on December 6, 1986, whom they feuded with from December 1986 to June 1987. When Rude left for the World Wrestling Federation, the title was given back to the Rock & Roll Express, with the explanation that they won the title accompanied by footage of a prior non-title match won by the Rock & Roll Express where they pinned the champions.\\n Passage 2:Kevin Steen (born May 7, 1984) is a Canadian professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Kevin Owens. He began his career in 2000 at the age of 16. Prior to joining WWE in late 2014, from 2007, Steen wrestled under his birth name for Ring of Honor (ROH), where he held the ROH World Championship and ROH World Tag Team Championship. Steen also wrestled extensively on the independent circuit for 14 years, most notably in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he held the PWG World Championship a record three times, as well as the PWG World Tag Team Championship on three occasions.\\n Passage 3:He won the 1993 and 1994 Touring Car World Cup events at Monza and at Donington respectively. 1993 was his first British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) season, in a Ford Mondeo prepared by Andy Rouse.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.","target":"Italy","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story.

Much of this belief was based on the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, a sixth-century mystic whose book, The Celestial Hierarchy, was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.

He was titled the 3rd Duke of Alba de Tormes, 4th Marquis of Coria, 3rd Count of Salvatierra de Tormes, 2nd Count of Piedrahita, 8th Lord of Valdecorneja, Grandee of Spain, and a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. His motto in Latin was Deo patrum Nostrorum, which in English means \\"To the God of our fathers\\". He was an adviser of King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), and his successor, Philip II of Spain, Mayordomo mayor of both, member of their Councils of State and War, governor of the Duchy of Milan (1555-1556), viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples (1556-1558), governor of the Netherlands (1567-1573) and viceroy and constable of the Kingdom of Portugal (1580-1582).\\n\\nIn later years, the focus of conflict between France and Spain had moved to the Italian peninsula. Alba was sent to Italy as commander in chief of the Spanish-Habsburg army in Italy, and became governor of Milan in 1555, and viceroy of Naples in 1556.  The newly appointed Pope Paul IV, an enemy of the Habsburgs, prompted King Henry II of France to expel the Spanish from Italy. Papal troops joined the French for this aim. In July 1556 the Pope declared Philip II was removed from the title King of Naples. Alba did not hesitate and marched on Rome at the head of 12,000 Spanish soldiers. He financed the campaign, in part, by obtaining a loan of 430,000 ducats from Bona Sforza, dowager Queen of Poland; the loan became known as Neapolitan sums and was never repaid. The Pope called for a truce, giving time for a French army commanded by Francis, Duke of Guise to march on Naples. The Spanish intercepted the French and defeated them in the Battle of San Quentin. Without French support, the papal troops were overwhelmed by the Spanish and the Duke of Alba entered Rome in September 1557. The pope had to sue for peace.  In 1559, peace was concluded, between the kings of Spain and France with the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis. With this treaty Spain had freed resources allowing colonization in the Americas. The treaty lasted for a century, and the Italian peninsula entered a prolonged period of rest. Peace between Spain and France was sealed by marriage between the Spanish monarch -the twice widowed Philip II- and Isabel de Valois, the daughter of the French king Henry II.

Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil.

I haven't talked with my mother regularly in two years and I think it took me a lot to get to that point. I guess I'll split this up by major events?\\n\\n2 years ago, pre-wedding:\\n\\nThere was a large family event, small-family (less than 20 with cousins and aunts) but the event was big enough to get most of them together, my mother was not explicitly invited.\\n\\nMy mother was not invited because the person getting married and she had not on spoken in years. It was decided that she would be allowed to act as a plus-one to any member that wanted to take her and basically everyone offered. My mom took to this as being a huge sign of disrespect, not getting an explicit invitation, and chose not to come. Eventually asking me not to participate either. I chose to go because I hadn't seen some of these cousins in years.\\n\\nThe out-of-town family was staying the weekend so I asked if we wanted to go to a theme park. Everyone ended up thinking it was a great idea. I invited my mom but then my aunt decided to go and my mom blew up. Also choosing not to go to that either. She had made it about herself, as if the theme park visit was about family getting to see her. At this point, I guess she decided she was having an argument with her sister.\\n\\nSo, I was casually asked to not go. I think a week or two before my mom tried to make plans for the weekend of the wedding to which I think I initially agreed. I think it was spring break maybe summer, I'm at uni hence the title. Once I realized the dates I made it clear I couldn't hang out with her. I think this is when I thought of going to the park and invited her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n2 years ago, post-wedding:\\n\\nMost of the family hung out excluding my mother. She chose not to come. I even pleaded for her to participate and it was a constant will she won't she. By the end of it, right as I was driving home, I think she sent a several \\"page\\" text (it's not really pages on iPhone anymore but you get the point?) maybe saying sorry but it quickly broke down into an argument. When arguing with her it's just so stressful trying to get all these things across and never getting a chance so I got to the point of finally saying alright express all you grievances so I can get my turn. It ended with her saying this aunt raped her with a water hose before I was born. She had never mentioned this and I don't really understand how this was relevant to the situation. It felt manipulative and I couldn't really process anything at all anymore so I told her she needed to leave me alone. \\n\\nI blocked her from my phone and that's really the only way to get a hold of me. She has my main email address and I never let it get out of control but shes never emailed. I could no longer handle the instability and unpredictability of her meltdowns. I think I had recently told her that and then like a day later a meltdown happened. It was like she was pretending not to hear me and would specifically do what I told her stressed me out.\\n\\nFast forward 1 year ago:\\n\\nThere was another wedding and literally, everyone was invited. I hadn't talked to my mother since the last one. I didn't sit with her at the ceremony or the after thing (the dance/ eating/ party thing after the church. I get confused on the terms, sorry.). I got pretty drunk and I think I started talking to her about my 17 years younger half-brother. He's basically illiterate and now aged in the double digits. I think she left shortly after? I know another aunt came over and tried to reconcile differences at some point. Deciding she would mediate but I think she had chosen to fight for my mom so not true meditation.  I know I got way drunk I can't remember much? I don't think I talked to my mom during this time through text.\\n\\nWithin a week:\\n\\nI've been doing great! I was constantly a nervous wreck most of my life. I always had terrible acne but I've been getting good sleep and eating well. My face is clear, I make great grades, and I'm making friends.\\n\\nI play Fortnite with my little brother and he has expressed that he planned on going to graduation. I texted my mother at the start of this semester, my senior year, to start coordinating plans for graduation. Earlier last week I texted her and asked if it would be okay to call, she agreed. The phone call went well. She was acting very nervous at first but I can't really guess why. She was like almost expecting a certain thing but sounded generally happy. I think she thought I was calling because I was like dying or something? I ended up having to hang up because of a quick emergency. So, I texted her back 5 minutes later and said it was good talking to you and said sorry for just springing up out of nowhere to talk. She responded with a massive text talking about how much I hurt her and that she'll remember these things \\"until the day I die\\" saying she left the most recent wedding early because of me. I accepted fault and said I was pretty drunk. Then it was just text after text of her resaying all the same stuff and not really listening to what I had to say. Similar to the last time we texted and maybe as it has always been?\\n\\nI recently read a book, the laws of human nature, and I have been considering peoples backgrounds when how they act. I have learned to understand my mother's behavior and I was trying to forgive her. I don't want to act the way she acts. This book explains it is very likely I will fall into the same habits if I don't stay conscious about it. I don't know why I reached out, I guess it's my mom. I want to be able to have a stable relationship.  \\n\\nAnyway, I asked my mom if it would be okay if I visit over the current winter break. She started sending all the texts about how disrespectful I was and that there need to be rules I have to accept if I'm to see my little brother. Honestly, it has been two years and she had acted cool in the texts earlier this semester about coming to graduation. Well, I didn't like the tone of the conversation so I said we would go back to not talking. She started being whishy-washy and tried to make it sound like it was her idea to not talk? Idk it sounds petty but I think it is relevant to say it was my choice.\\n\\nPrevious 24 hours:\\n\\nShe is obviously pissed and was talking about years of grief. When I expressed one thing specifically that she constantly makes me feel bad about she acted as if she was never mad about that and made it seem like it was actually me who was mad over this event 14 years in the past. She graduated from college and moved me into my dads while she lived with the aunt I mentioned earlier. I decided to stay with my dad once she got an apartment and shes always told me how it hurt her and never accepts an apology for it. I mentioned this grievance and she made it seem like she was never mad about me staying with my dad and that she thought I was the one mad this whole time. Like what do I even have to be mad about that I stayed living with my dad?\\n\\nI decided to uninvite her to my graduation. It is way too much stress. She hasn't helped me with the price of a cheeseburger since I started. She never really makes me feel good about myself. I just don't want to talk to her at all anymore. I've started a new book about surviving psychological abuse and she is a textbook abuser. \\\\*cue I can see clearly now\\\\*. \\n\\nI texted her and I think I'll just copy paste? me: Well, I put a lot of thought into it. I don’t want you at my graduation. I’m no longer interested in maintaining a relationship. You had a lot of terrible things to say and if I ever try to explain how you make me feel you minimize or ignore it maybe you say I have the wrong memory all-together. Anyway, I don’t wanna deal with it anymore. I was really trying to be nice when I reached out, you’re very angry. I think you project a lot so I feel like I sound like you when I’m trying to explain what you do but that’s for you to figure out! Bye I guess \\n\\nHer: You know what Erick, I’m done with you son. You’ve been so disrespectful and shitty towards me since you were about 11. You’ve got issues, and you need to grow up! I’m a good mom and was a “great” mom to you. You totally don’t deserve me. Thank God I have \\\\[little bro\\\\] because if all I had as a reference as a mom and you were my only child I’d probably have shot myself. Don’t contact me again.\\n\\nSo, grand-finale, my mother just told me she would have killed herself if I was her only son and that I've been terrible since I was 11? Who gets mad at an 11-year-old. She has a social work degree, I would think they tell you it is never the child's fault?\\n\\nI think I'm better off. I think she's being manipulative and knows full well what she does.\\n\\nTL;DR  First, I think you need to read it all, I know I needed to write it! Haven't talked to my mom in 2 years. She hasn't talked with most of her family in as long or much much longer. I told her she is not invited to my college graduation and that I don't want to talk to her anymore. She said she would have killed herself if I was her only son and to not contact her anymore.\\n\\nJust here for the judgment.

The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added in between the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".","target":"Deism","rationale":"According to the context, many people in the enlightenment were thinkers and they agreed with Deism.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex. \\nQuestion: Julia Child is known for her throaty laugh which Europeans and Americans alike heard on her \\"French Chef\\" television series.

Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"ruling classes","rationale":"The question asks for a common thought as to why there were so many Muslims in Southeast Asia other than trade and Sufi missionaries. The context suggests that the ruling classes embraced Islam, which led to an \\"accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region.\\" Since it is mentioned within a list of reasons outside those already provided by the question (trade and Sufis), this may be considered another reason behind the spread of Islam.\\nSo, based on our understanding from reading this sentence, we can tell that people believed \\"ruling classes\\" played part in spreading Muslim faith across southeast Asian countries."},{"source":"I am hesitating between 4 options to answer the following question, which option should I choose?\\nQuestion: Some foods that humans eat, such as corn and peas, are actually seeds from plants.

We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in human serum.

Cognitive advances encompass both increases in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively.

For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations.

Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output.

Mutations result from errors during DNA replication or other types of damage to DNA, which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining), or cause an error during other forms of repair, or else may cause an error during replication (translesion synthesis). Mutations may also result from insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements. Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system, including junctional diversity.\\n\\n- Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea.

In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.\\n\\n- Haemophilia, also spelled hemophilia, is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Those with mild disease may only have symptoms after an accident or during surgery. Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness.\\nThere are two main types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene. Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to not enough factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to not enough factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood for its ability to clot and its levels of clotting factors.\\nPrevention may occur by removing an egg, fertilizing it, and testing the embryo before transferring it to the uterus. Treatment is by replacing the missing blood clotting factors. This may be done on a regular basis or during bleeding episodes. Replacement may take place at home or in hospital. The clotting factors are made either from human blood or by recombinant methods. Up to 20% of people develop antibodies to the clotting factors which makes treatment more difficult. The medication desmopressin may be used in those with mild haemophilia A. Studies of gene therapy are in early human trials.\\nHaemophilia A affects about 1 in 5,00010,000, while haemophilia B affects about 1 in 40,000, males at birth.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania.\\nArchaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.\\nDuring the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.\\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\\n\\n- An embryo is an early stage of development of a multicellular diploid eukaryotic organism. In general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents. In plants, animals, and some protists, the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo.\\n\\n- The uterus (from Latin \\"uterus\\", plural \\"uteri\\") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of humans and most other mammals. In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. In the embryo the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.\\n\\n- French (or ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as all Romance languages. French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïllanguages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as \\"Francophone\\" in both English and French.\\n\\n- Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\"\\n\\n- Haitian Creole is a French-based creole language spoken by 9.612million people worldwide, and the only language of most Haitians. It is a creole language based largely on 18th century French with influences from Portuguese, Spanish, English, Taíno, and West African languages. Haitian Creole emerged from contact between French settlers and African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Haitians are the largest creole-speaking community in the world.\\n\\n- Faith Healer is a play by Brian Friel about the life of the faith healer Francis Hardy as monologued through the shifting memories of Hardy, his wife, Grace, and stage manager, Teddy.\\n\\n- Pierre Gilliard ( 16 May 1879 -- 30 May 1962 ) was a Swiss academic and author , best known as the French language tutor to the five children of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia from 1905 to 1918 . In 1921 , after the Russian Revolution of 1917 , he published a memoir , Thirteen Years at the Russian Court , about his time with the family . In his memoirs , Gilliard described Tsarina Alexandra 's torment over her son 's haemophilia and her faith in the ability of starets Grigori Rasputin to heal the boy .\\n\\n- Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin was a Russian peasant, an experienced traveler, a mystical faith healer, and trusted friend of the family of Nicholas II, the last Tsar of the Russian Empire. He became an influential figure in Saint Petersburg, especially after August 1915 when Nicholas took command of the army fighting in World War I. Advising his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, in countless spiritual and political issues, Rasputin became an easy scapegoat for Russian nationalists, aristocrats and liberals.\\n\\n- Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.\\n\\n- Pregnancy, also known as gravidity or gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman. A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins. Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. It usually lasts around 40 weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP) and ends in childbirth. This is just over nine lunar months, where each month is about 29 days. When measured from conception it is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following conception, after which, the term \\"fetus\\" is used until birth. Symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods, tender breasts, nausea and vomiting, hunger, and frequent urination. Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test.\\nPregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters. The first trimester is from week one through 12 and includes conception. Conception is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the fetus and placenta. The first trimester carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). The second trimester is from week 13 through 28. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided high-quality medical care. The third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks.\\nPrenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes. Prenatal care may include taking extra folic acid, avoiding drugs and alcohol, regular exercise, blood tests, and regular physical examinations. Complications of pregnancy may include high blood pressure of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, iron-deficiency anemia, and severe nausea and vomiting among others.

Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.\\n\\nand a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania?","target":"Tanzania","rationale":"The A horizon is the top layer of soil which has been mixed with organic matter and contains most of a soil’s nutrients. Because Kenya’s grasslands have frequent fires, this causes much more root growth than fire-free forested areas like Tanzania would have. This would cause there to be greater amounts of fibrous roots in Kenya than Tanzania, resulting in an increased amount of organics being added to the soil over time. Since forests do not experience as many fires as grassland does, their A horizons will develop at a slower rate (and thus they will contain less humus)."},{"source":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?\\nJoel H.

I had this friend in high school that I would constantly go to parties with and play video games with and we had a similar sense of humour but I really didn't like him for a number of reasons:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- He would always need money. He would want me to buy him food, he would need me to buy him cigarettes (I hate smoking so this really pissed me off) and he would also want me to give him money so he could buy weed. It got to the point where he owed me at least 200 dollars. Remember, this is high school, money is scarce and every amount of it I had, my parents are asking what I did with it. It pissed me off that I would be decent enough to give him some of the money my parents would allow me to have to spend on things I wanted and he would never pay me back and joke about how he never would like it wasn't a serious issue for me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- He would take advantages of privileges my parents would afford me and ruin them. An example is that my dad would let me use his car every so often but it cam under the condition that I treat the car with respect and this friend would constantly insist on smoking cigarettes in the car and would light up without asking first. I got in trouble multiple times because of this and had car privileges revoked. He would also say we should just smoke weed in the car and then drive back to one of our places like driving under the influence wasn't a big deal. What if a bunch of intoxicated 16-17 year olds get pulled over by the police while high out of our minds. My license would get taken away and he didn't seem to care. Just do it! Whats the big deal??? And he would act like I was being a bitch about these things.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- He wanted to smoke weed every day. I am someone who has a bit of an addiction problem with weed. If I smoke it every day, my grades tank, I start putting on serious amounts of fat, and generally become a less functioning person but he insists on smoking it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo basically what I did was continue the friendship until graduation and then when I didn't need to see him again, I cut all contact and never spoke to him again. He would continue texting me for a few weeks after that wondering what was going on but I didn't respond. I just ghosted him hard and I feel bad about it sometimes. But I've barely smoked week since and lost 40 pounds and put on a bit of muscle. My grades in University were actually similar to those in high school which is unheard of. I'm just a better person and many of the goals in my life couldn't be achieved while catering to the type of lifestyle he insisted on if we were to continue hanging out. I don't really have any friends from high school though because they decided to stick with him rather than me.

It was established in November 1931 by future Communist Party of China leader Mao Zedong, General Zhu De and others, and it lasted until 1937. Discontiguous territories included the Northeastern Jiangxi, Hunan-Jiangxi, Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi, Hunan-Western Hubei, Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou, Shaanxi-Gansu, Szechuan-Shensi, Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Honghu and Haifeng-Lufeng Soviets.\\nMao Zedong was both CSR state chairman and prime minister; he led the state and its government. Mao's tenure as head of a \\"small state within a state\\" gave him experience in mobile warfare and peasant organization; this experience helped him accomplish the Communist reunification of China during the late 1940s. The CSR was eventually destroyed by the Kuomintang (KMT)'s National Revolutionary Army in a series of 1934 encirclement campaigns. Following the Xi'an Incident of December 1936, the Communists and Kuomintang formed an uneasy \\"United Front\\" to resist Japanese pressure, which led to the Communists recognizing at least for the moment Chiang Kai-shek as China's leader and the official dissolution of the Soviet Republic on 22 September 1937.\\n\\n- The First Encirclement Campaign ( Chinese :  ) against Jiangxi Soviet was a series of battles launched by the Chinese Nationalist Government intended to annihilate the Chinese Red Army , and destroy the Chinese Soviet Republic . The communists later responded with the First Counter-Encirclement Campaign at Central Soviet ( Chinese :  ) , also called by the communists as the First Counter-Encirclement Campaign at Central Revolutionary Base ( Chinese :  ) , in which the Red Army successfully defended the Soviet Republic in the southern Jiangxi province against Nationalist attacks from November 1930 to January 3 , 1931 .\\n\\n- The Constitution of the Republic of China is the fundamental law of the Republic of China (ROC), which since 1949 only controls the \\"free area of the Republic of China\\", which is essentially the island of Taiwan and some minor outlying islands, the only territories not lost to the Chinese Communists in the Chinese Civil War. It was adopted by the National Constituent Assembly on 25 December 1946, and went into effect on 25 December 1947, at a time when the ROC still had nominal control of Mainland China and to which this constitution applied. This made China (with approx. 450 million people at that time) the most populous \\"paper democracy\\" in the world. The latest revision to the constitution was in 2004.\\n\\n- The Yangtze River (or ), known in China as the Cháng Jing (literally: \\"Long River\\") or the Yángz Jing, is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world. The river is the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It drains one-fifth of the land area of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and its river basin is home to one-third of the country's population. The Yangtze is the sixth-largest river by discharge volume in the world.\\n\\n- Fujian (pronounced ), formerly romanised as Foken, Fouken, Fukien, and Hokkien, is a province on the southeast coast of mainland China. Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north, Jiangxi to the west, and Guangdong to the south.

Born poor in 1886 in Sichuan, Zhu was adopted by a wealthy uncle at age nine; this prosperity provided him a superior early education that led to his admission into a military academy. After his time at the academy, he joined a rebel army, and soon became a warlord. It was after this period that he adopted communism. He ascended through the ranks of the Red Army as it closed in on securing the nation. By the time China was under Mao's control, Zhu was a high-ranking official within the Communist Party of China. He served as Commander-in-Chief during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1955, Zhu became one of the Ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army, of which he is regarded as the principal founder. Zhu remained a prominent political figure until his death in 1976. As the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress from 1975 to 1976, Zhu was the head of state of the People's Republic of China.\\n\\n- The Nationalist government, officially the National Government of the Republic of China, refers to the government of the Republic of China between 1 July 1925 to 20 May 1948, led by the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party). The name derives from the Kuomintang's translated name \\"Nationalist Party\\".

It is located in South Central China, south of the middle course of the Yangtze River, and south of Lake Dongting (hence the name \\"Hunan\\", which means \\"south of the lake\\"). Hunan is sometimes called for short and officially abbreviated as \\"\\" (pinyin: Xing), named after the Xiang River which runs through the province.\\n\\n- Anhui is a landlocked province of the People's Republic of China located in the eastern region of the country. Located across the basins of the Yangtze River and the Huai River, it borders Jiangsu to the east, Zhejiang to the southeast, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei to the southwest, Henan to the northwest, and Shandong for a short section in the north. The provincial capital is Hefei.\\n\\n- A peasant is a member of a traditional class of farmers, either laborers or owners of small farms, especially in the Middle Ages under feudalism, or more generally, in any pre-industrial society. In Europe, peasants were divided into three classes according to their personal status: slave, serf, and free tenant. Peasants either hold title to land in fee simple, or hold land by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage, quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.\\n\\n- The Xi'an Incident of December 1936, an important turning point in Chinese modern history, took place in the city of Xi'an during the Chinese Civil War between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the insurgent Chinese Communist Party and just before the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 12 December 1936, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang, was arrested by Marshal Zhang Xueliang, a former warlord of Manchuria and Commander of the North Eastern Army who had fought against the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and subsequent expansion into Inner Mongolia by the Japanese and troops of the puppet state of Manchukuo that had been created in Manchuria.\\n\\n- A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state.\\nIn parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or the head of state's official representative (i.e. the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers.\\n\\n- Mao Zedong or Mao Tse-tung (December 26, 1893September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he ruled as an autocrat styled the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949, until his death in 1976. His MarxistLeninist theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.\\n\\n- Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population. The provincial capital Guangzhou and economic hub Shenzhen are among the most populous and important cities in China. The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people.\\n\\n- The National Revolutionary Army (NRA), sometimes shortened to Revolutionary Army () before 1928, and as National Army () after 1928, was the military arm of the Kuomintang (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) from 1925 until 1947 in the Republic of China. It also became the regular army of the ROC during the KMT's period of party rule beginning in 1928. It was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces' () after the 1947 Constitution, which instituted civilian control of the military.\\n\\n- The Government of the Republic of China was formally established in 1912 in Nanking, with Sun Yat-sen as President of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China under the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China. This government moved to Beijing in the same year with Yuan Shikai as President, and continued under his successors as the internationally recognized government of China until 1928. In the Republican period, there were a series of governments, sometimes in rivalry with each other. The Nationalist government, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), was originally formed as a rival military government under Sun Yat-sen in Guangzhou in 1917. After Sun's death in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek led the Northern Expedition (19261928) to unify the country and established the capital in Nanjing. This government gained diplomatic recognition but did not control all the territory of the Qing dynasty. The essentially one-party rule functioned under Sun's Three Principles of the People, which provided for a transitional period of \\"tutelage\\", but drew more political parties, including the Communist Party of China into a United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The Tutelage Constitution of 1931 was replaced by the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947.\\n\\n- Jiangxi (Gan: Kongsi) is a province in the People's Republic of China, located in the southeast of the country. Spanning from the banks of the Yangtze river in the north into hillier areas in the south and east, it shares a border with Anhui to the north, Zhejiang to the northeast, Fujian to the east, Guangdong to the south, Hunan to the west, and Hubei to the northwest.\\n\\n- Chiang Kai-shek (October 31, 1887  April 5, 1975), also romanized as Jiang Jieshi and known as Jiang Zhongzheng, was a Chinese political and military leader who served as the leader of the Republic of China between 1928 and 1975. Chiang was an influential member of the Kuomintang (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, and was a close ally of Sun Yat-sen's. He became the Commandant of the Kuomintang's Whampoa Military Academy and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT, following the Canton Coup in early 1926. Having neutralized the party's left wing, Chiang then led Sun's long-postponed Northern Expedition, conquering or reaching accommodations with China's many warlords.\\n\\n- The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader.

He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur.

The social democrats voted against the Senate's proposal, while presenting an alternative declaration of sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a guaranteed conclusion for the small Finnish nation. Recognition by Russia and other great powers was essential; Svinhufvud accepted that he had to negotiate with Lenin for the acknowledgement. The socialists, having been reluctant to enter talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to request that Lenin approve Finnish sovereignty. In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and the Bolsheviks' rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud's delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917. By the beginning of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany , hoping to override Lenin's regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire.

With her performance as Diana Guzman, a troubled teen who decides to channel her aggression by training to become a boxer, Rodriguez accumulated several awards and nominations for the role in independent circles, including major acting accolades from the National Board of Review, Deauville Film Festival, Independent Spirit Awards, Gotham Awards, Las Vegas Film Critics Sierra Awards, and many others. The film itself took home a top prize at the Sundance and won Award of the Youth at the Cannes Film Festival.  Rodriguez has had notable roles in other successful movies, including Letty in The Fast and the Furious (2001) and Rain Ocampo in Resident Evil (2002). She also appeared in Blue Crush and S.W.A.T.. In 2004, Rodriguez lent her voice to the video game Halo 2, playing a Marine. She also provided the voice of Liz Ricarro in the Cartoon Network series IGPX. From 2005 to 2006, she played tough cop Ana Lucia Cortez on the television series Lost during the show's second season (the character's first appearance was a flashback during the first season's finale, \\"Exodus: Part 1\\"), and returned for a cameo in the second episode of the show's fifth season, \\"The Lie\\", in 2009. She returned again in the penultimate episode of the series, \\"What They Died For\\", in 2010. In 2006, Rodriguez was featured in her own episode of G4's show Icons.  In 2008, Rodriguez appeared in the political drama Battle in Seattle opposite Charlize Theron and Woody Harrelson. In 2009, she appeared in Fast & Furious, the fourth installment of The Fast and the Furious film series. Later that year, Rodriguez starred in James Cameron's high-budget sci-fi adventure epic Avatar, which became the highest-grossing film in history and Rodriguez's most successful film to date. In 2009, Rodriguez also starred in Tropico de Sangre, an independent film based on the Dominican Republic's historic Mirabal sisters.  In 2010, Rodriguez appeared in Robert Rodriguez's Machete. In 2011, she appeared with Aaron Eckhart in the science fiction film Battle: Los Angeles which grossed over US$200 million in the worldwide box office. In 2012, she returned to play the good clone and bad clone of Rain Ocampo in Resident Evil: Retribution. In 2013, she reprised her roles as Letty in Fast & Furious 6 and Luz / She in the Robert Rodriguez sequel Machete Kills. She also voiced a character in DreamWorks Animation's Turbo.  In 2015, she appeared in Furious 7 which grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide. In 2017, she lent her voice to Smurfs: The Lost Village. She also starred in The Fate of the Furious, which broke records for the largest global box office opening of all-time. She'll next be reunited with director James Cameron for Alita: Battle Angel and star opposite Viola Davis in Widows from award-winning director Steve McQueen.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Michelle Rodriguez","rationale":"The context is a description of the life and career of Michelle Rodriguez.

But we occasionally encounter a strong acid or base, such as stomach acid, which has a strongly acidic pH of 1.7. By definition, strong acids and bases can produce a relatively large amount of H+ or OH−ions and consequently have marked chemical activities. In addition, very small amounts of strong acids and bases can change the pH of a solution very quickly. If 1 mL of stomach acid [approximated as 0.1 M HCl(aq)] were added to the bloodstream and no correcting mechanism were present, the pH of the blood would decrease from about 7.4 to about 4.7—a pH that is not conducive to continued living. Fortunately, the body has a mechanism for minimizing such dramatic pH changes. The mechanism involves a buffer, a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH. Buffers do so by being composed of certain pairs of solutes: either a weak acid plus a salt derived from that weak acid or a weak base plus a salt of that weak base. For example, a buffer can be composed of dissolved HC2H3O2 (a weak acid) and NaC2H3O2 (the salt derived from that weak acid). Another example of a buffer is a solution containing NH3 (a weak base) and NH4Cl (a salt derived from that weak base). Let us use an HC2H3O2/NaC2H3O2 buffer to demonstrate how buffers work. If a strong base—a source of OH−(aq) ions—is added to the buffer solution, those OH− ions will react with the HC2H3O2 in an acid-base reaction:.\\n\\n\\nQ: What is the term for a solution that resists dramatic changes in ph?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"buffer","rationale":"A buffer is a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH.

The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium—a gas, a liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum (Figure 36.16). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light—a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light. Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency) manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm.

In early 1920, he spent time in prison for protesting against the People's Party (PP) government's clampdown on Ukrainian socialism. He ran in the elections of May against Bogatyrets, taking a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, where he demanded a plebiscite over the territorial status of Bukovina and Maramureș. The election of November 1922 were held under the watch of National Liberal Party (PNL), which supported centralizing policies. During the race, the incumbent Rusyn Senator Jevhen Kozak was arrested and intimidated. Fearing persecution, Krakalia made his way into the opposition Peasants' Party; the other Ukrainian socialists soon came into contact with the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, and were either arrested or pushed to leave Romania.\\n Passage 2:He attended schools in Brixen and Innsbruck and served as a nurse during the Franco-Prussian War.

(In fact, Neptune is currently the farthest planet from the Sun‹since the early 1970s, Pluto has been closer to the Sun than Neptune has, and it will remain so until the end of this century.) * At this distance, Neptune receives nearly 1,000 times less sunlight than Earth, and about two and one-half times less than Uranus, but its overall temperature is about the same as that of Uranus. 1,500-M.P.H. Winds Found on Neptune THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AN FRANCISCO -- Neptune is swept by 1,500 mile-an-hour winds, the fastest yet discovered in the solar system, scientists have determined from analyzing photographs taken by Voyager 2. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. The scientists discovered the winds blow in relatively thin weather layers no more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) deep on both planets. For comparison, Neptune is about 30,600 miles (49,250 km) in diameter, while Uranus is approximately 31,500 miles (50,700 km) wide. These findings help reveal how these winds originate, researchers said. Quick Answer. Neptune takes 19 hours to complete its spin. It takes 165 Earth years to make one orbit around the sun, which equates to one year on Neptune. Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system, and it is at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles from the sun. Nothing on Jupiter remains the same. In terms of size growth, it can't really grow in latitude, as it is bound by Jupiter's zonal winds. That can change slightly, and it could expand in longitude, though we haven't seen them ever really do that (both the GRS and predecessor ovals have shrunk in longitudinal extent over the years). Started wondering about the speed of sound on Neptune when I heard winds there can reach in excess of 1500+ mph, well above Earth's speed of sound. According to this report, the speed of sound could range from 600-740 m/s or 1350-1650 mph on Neptune. What happens when wind speed break the sound barrier? Would these storms create a sonic boom effect? May 17, 2013. This image of Neptune was taken during the August 16-17, 1989, period as Voyager 2 photographed the planet almost continuously, but had no way to measure the winds or how deep they reach into the atmosphere. Now, scientists have turned to subtle changes in the planet's gravity for clues. Best Answer: Neptune also has 2,500 km/h winds of hydrogen, helium, and methane that gives the planet its blue appearance. Neptune weather is characterized by extremely violent hurricanes, whose winds reach 1,000 mph. winds on neptune blow 10 times than the earth's (or 700 m/second), in fact, neptune has the great dark spot in which storms whirls like swirling clouds. hadouken07 · 1 decade ago 0 Query: how fast can the winds on neptune","target":"Neptune has 2,500 km/h of winds","rationale":"Here's a direct answer: Neptune has 2,500 km/h of winds."},{"source":"In 2010, a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of baboons that were brought back as gifts from Punt by the ancient Egyptians.

We prospectively studied 1083 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy (241 of whom were excluded because of malignant disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, familial polyposis, or partial colectomy).

On September 19, 1919, Polish troops attacked Gelvonai and encroached towards Ukmergė. On several occasions fights broke out regarding strategically important bridge over the Šventoji River near Vepriai. In October, when main Lithuanian forces were deployed against the Bermontians in northwestern Lithuania, the attacks intensified. Poles captured Salakas on October 5 and attacked Kapčiamiestis on October 12. The front stabilized, but harassment of border guards and local villagers continued throughout late 1919 and early 1920. In March 1920, the Poles attacked along the railroad stations in Kalkūni and Turmantas. The situation was investigated by British and French observers and reported to the Entente. The situation somewhat improved only in late spring 1920 when most Polish troops were deployed in Ukraine during the Polish-Soviet War. At the time Lithuania faced a severe budget crisis - in 1919 its revenue was 72 million while expenses reached 190 million German marks. While the government was struggling to obtain financial assistance and loans, deep cuts affected the army.
