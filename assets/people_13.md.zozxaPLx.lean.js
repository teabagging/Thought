Research tests have proven that solar panels can last for 40 years or longer! It is not uncommon for a home solar panel installation to deliver $50,000, $75,000, or even $100,000 in cumulative energy savings over time. For more examples, view the Southern Current Solar Install Portfolio. If solar power was used to charge the Powerwall, it would save the charging fee of $0.45 a day, making the Powerwall savings each year $358. Factoring in the installed solar panel cost of $3,570[2] for a 1.5 kilowatt system[iii], makes the payback period 31 years, still 3 times the warranty period. If you’re reviewing multiple quotes, there are plenty of metrics that can help you make a decision about which solar option is best for you, but studies show most solar shoppers rely on one metric in particular: the solar panel payback period. Here’s how the numbers pencil out for a North Carolina solar purchase with a small rooftop solar system: 1  First-year loan payments: $948. - 2  First-year electric bill savings: $275. = 3  First-year cost of solar: $673. 4  First year federal tax credit: $2,340. 5  Total in your pocket after year 1: $1,667. For most homeowners in Bee Cave who pay cash instead of financing, the average solar panel installation will pay for itself in 11 years. What this means is that over 11 years, the value of energy produced by a solar energy system should equal the cost to have the system installed.

Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended 2.5 miles (4 km) in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists...\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Harry Glicken","rationale":"He was a volcanologist.

I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company.  Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species.

The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide also increased during viloxazine therapy, but to a lesser extent (16%). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of viloxazine. In a seventh patient, viloxazine had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide levels (by 197% and 137% respectively). Although viloxazine appears to be one of the few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine. The mechanism of the interaction probably involves inhibition of the metabolism of both carbamazepine and its active epoxide metabolite. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Blastoderm 3)Drosophila","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that investigated the effects of combining viloxazine and carbamazepine, two therapeutic drugs used to treat epilepsy.

By road it is 912 kilometres (567 mi) south of Hyderabad, 322 kilometres (200 mi) south-west of Chennai and 331 kilometres (206 mi) south-east of Bangalore. The topology of Tiruchirappalli is almost flat, with an average elevation of 88 metres (289 ft). A few isolated hillocks rise above the surface, the highest of which is the Rockfort; its estimated age of 3,800 million years makes it one of the oldest rocks in the world. Other prominent hillocks include the Golden Rock, Khajamalai, and one each at Uyyakondan Thirumalai and Thiruverumbur.The two major rivers draining Tiruchirappalli are the Kaveri and its tributary the Kollidam, but the city is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel, Koraiyar and Kudamuritti river channels. The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil.

Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications. Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession. In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \\"exciting developments\\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based. \\"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology. \\"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP). More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love. They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology. Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation.

Following Gifford's death in 2015, his wife Kathie Lee Gifford said that her late husband grew up in a poverty-stricken home and that he and his family sometimes ate dog food. She said they lived in 29 places even before Gifford attended high school because his father could not find work during the Depression.\\n\\nGifford married his college sweetheart, USC's homecoming queen Maxine Avis Ewart, on January 13, 1952, after she became pregnant while they were students at USC. They had three children, Jeff (b. 1952), Kyle and Victoria, and five grandchildren. Victoria married Michael LeMoyne Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy. Gifford was then married to fitness trainer Astrid Lindley from 1978 to 1986. The first two marriages ended in divorce. Gifford married television presenter and singer Kathie Lee Johnson, who was 23 years his junior, on October 18, 1986. The couple settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, with their son, Cody Newton Gifford, and daughter, Cassidy Erin Gifford. Gifford and his third wife Kathie Lee both shared the same birthday, which was August 16. The couple co-hosted ABC's coverage of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.  Gifford had an older sister and younger brother, Winona and Waine.  In 1997, the tabloid magazine Globe arranged to have Gifford secretly videotaped being seduced by former flight attendant Suzen Johnson in a New York City hotel room. They published photos and stories. ESPN reported that the tabloid paid Johnson $75,000 to lure Gifford to the room, while The Atlantic said it was $125,000.

Most (93%) of the rats on the high protein diet died within three days following renal ischemia. In addition, 69% of the rats on normal protein diets also died, most before the fourth day following ischemic insult. In contrast, 88% of the rats on the low protein diet lived, although some exhibited elevated serum creatinine levels for up to one to two weeks following ischemia. Finally, all of the rats on no protein diets lived, and most (75%) exhibited normal serum creatinine levels by the fourth day following ischemia. Shifting the diets of high protein and normal protein adapted rats to no protein diets immediately following ischemia did not improve postischemic survival. Also, changing the diets of no protein adapted rats to high protein diets immediately following ischemia did not significantly affect postischemic recovery. When rats were maintained on no protein diets for shorter periods of time prior to ischemia, it was found that approximately a week on this diet is necessary to provide maximum protection from postischemic acute renal failure.

Alan Borovoy described Kaplansky as \`\` the zaideh '' ( grandfather ) of the Canadian human rights movement . Kaplansky was born in Biaystok in what is now Poland and emigrated to Montreal after graduating from high school in 1929 . He attempted to enroll at McGill University but the university 's registrar told the young Jewish immigrant that \`\` my job is to keep people like you out of the university . '' He was a printer by profession and worked as a linotype operator and typesetter from 1932 to 1943 .

Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.\\n\\n- New Zealand English (NZE) is the dialect of the English language spoken by most English-speaking New Zealanders. Its language code in ISO and Internet standards is en-NZ. English is one of New Zealand's three official languages (along with New Zealand Sign Language and \\"te reo Mori\\") and is the first language of the majority of the population.\\n\\n- South African English (SAfrE, SAfrEng, SAE, en-ZA) is the set of English dialects spoken by South Africans. There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.\\n\\n- Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'kalmen kaplansky' and 'human rights activist'?","target":"occupation","rationale":"The rationale is that:\\n- The relationship between 'kalmen kaplansky' and 'human rights activist' should be occupation."},{"source":"Read the given query and classify it as a 'Good' or 'Bad' query depending on how well the query is formed, 'Bad' being the expected output for a not so well formed query and 'Good' being the expected output for a well formed query.

Critics say the president and top public health officials painted too rosy a picture of the country’s state of readiness. As proof, they point to the infection of two Dallas health care workers who treated the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Conservative pundit George Will attacked what to him was the hubris in those early statements. \\"\\"The problem is the original assumption, said with great certitude if not certainty, was that you need to have direct contact, meaning with bodily fluids from someone because it’s (Ebola) not airborne,\\"\\" Will said Oct. 19 on Fox News Sunday. \\"\\"There are doctors who are saying that in a sneeze or some cough, some of the airborne particles can be infectious.\\"\\" Will also said Ebola could survive on a dry surface \\"\\"for a number of days.\\"\\" Show host Chris Wallace cut Will off, asserting that Ebola does not spread like the flu, which does move from person to person when someone with the illness is out in public. When another guest challenged Will to cite his source, he ultimately referred to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Here, we’re fact-checking Will’s claim that scientists say a cough or sneeze can spread Ebola. From the context of the discussion, we understand that Will was talking about the risk to the general public. We reached out to Will and did not hear back but thanks to the rumor website Snopes, we have a pretty good idea where he got his information. In mid September, the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy posted a commentary from two University of Illinois professors. The commentary, co-written by Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, argued that health care workers treating patients with Ebola should wear respirators. Face masks, they said, are not enough. We asked Brosseau if Will had correctly relayed her work. Brosseau said her views had nothing to do with Ebola spreading among the public at large. The focus was on health care workers treating people in the isolation wards. \\"\\"We were concerned about aerosols generated by infected patients in the most severe stage of the disease,\\"\\" Brosseau said. Will had mistakenly connected the pathway of infection in a hospital room with someone coughing or sneezing in public. As has been well documented, the first symptom of infection is a fever. As the virus multiplies in the body, vomiting and diarrhea set in. Brosseau had written that it is possible that for patients in that condition, tiny water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could get into the air and be inhaled. In a laboratory experiment, monkeys with hoods over their heads could acquire the Ebola virus, but Brosseau said that lab experiments should be put in context. \\"\\"We are not aware of any published data about the viability or infectiousness of the Ebola organism in aerosols in the real world,\\"\\" Brosseau told PunditFact. \\"\\"It appears unlikely that the public will be exposed to infectious aerosols because they are not likely to encounter infected people experiencing the severe symptoms.\\"\\" We found similar views in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases, and summaries issued by the Centers for Disease Control , the World Health Organization and the New England Journal of Medicine. Adam Lauring, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Michigan, emphasized that Ebola is not a respiratory disease. Coughing and sneezing are not symptoms in the way that they are with the flu. Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, said if someone with Ebola sneezed or coughed into your face when you were close to them, that could transmit the virus through droplets. But, \\"\\"It’s important to note that this form of transmission does not constitute 'airborne,' \\"\\" Gire said. \\"\\"This is still a form of direct contact.\\"\\" \\"\\"If you were on a plane, and someone sneezed, you wouldn’t be at risk of getting infected unless you were sneezed on directly within close quarters, and that cough or sneeze transferred droplets into mucosal membranes. This is very unlikely scenario, but not out of the realm of possibility. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been sneezed on directly, and only one of those times was by someone I didn’t know.\\"\\" One of the problems with the public debate over Ebola, Lauring said, is that science can’t prove that something will never happen. On the other hand, he also said we ought to look at what has happened. \\"\\"If airborne transmission was an imminent concern, one would have to ask why no one in the United States has been infected except for two people who had close contact with the patient,\\"\\" Lauring said. \\"\\"Importantly, none of the people who were living with the patient prior to his second trip to thee Texas hospital have been infected.\\"\\" While we are not fact-checking Will’s statement about infectious particles remaining alive for several days on a dry surface, Lauring said he knows of no evidence of that. Gire said it's theoretically possible under the right conditions, though it's highly unlikely. Our ruling Will said that some scientists say that Ebola can be transmitted in public by a sneeze or a cough. The source of that was a commentary about the risks to hospital workers treating people in advanced stages of the disease. One of the authors of that commentary said her work applied only to health care workers in those settings. The medical literature says sneezing and coughing are not part of the disease’s typical symptoms, and experts we reached drew a bright line between what might happen in a hospital isolation ward and a person with early symptoms of Ebola before he or she is admitted. There is no evidence that Ebola has been transmitted in the general public through coughing or sneezing. Will took a medical commentary out of context. Update (Noon, Oct. 20): After we published this item, we heard from some folks who disagreed with our ruling. Read our response here.\\" Claim: \\"Some doctors say Ebola can be transmitted through the air by \\"\\"a sneeze or some cough.\\"","target":"0","rationale":"The paragraph provides evidence that counters the claim. It states that Ebola is not a respiratory disease and that coughing and sneezing are not symptoms of the disease.

The paragraph does not provide any evidence supporting the claim that Ebola can be transmitted by a sneeze or cough.

Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the \\"same 40 songs\\". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide \\"quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, Australian Idol and St Ives.

It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of \\"Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt\\" (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is \\"I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard.

Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them \\"[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles.

Some later copies of Forever Malcolm Young contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled Sucking All Over the World.

A Baltimore field goal tightened the lead before Carr hit Michael Crabtree for his first of three touchdown scores on the day, and the Raiders took a 14-6 lead to the half as the Raiders defense held the Ravens in check.

Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01).

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.\\n\\nParagraph: Two farmers, Tom and Brad, applied different farming methods.

I loved him beyond all reasons.\\nI joined a riding club. When Cowboy and I entered the events where the horse was judged by appearance, we were quickly \\"shown the gate\\". I knew nothing could turn Cowboy into a beauty. My only chance to compete would be in the timed speed events. I chose the jumping race.\\nFor the whole next month we practiced running and jumping for hours in the hot sun and then I would walk Cowboy home, totally exhausted.\\nAll of our hard work didn't make me feel confident by the time the show came. One girl named Becky rode a big brown horse in the race events. She always won the blue ribbons. I sat at the gate and sweated all out while I watched Becky and her horse charge through the court and finish in first place.\\nMy turn finally came. At the signal, we dashed toward the first fence, jumped over it without trouble and raced on to the next one. Cowboy then flew over the second, third and fourth fences like a bird and I turned him toward the finish line.\\nNo cheers filled the air. The end of our run was met with surprised silence. Cowboy and I had beaten Becky and her fancy horse by two seconds.\\nI gained much more than a blue ribbon that day. At thirteen, I realized that no matter what the odds, I'd always come out a winner if I wanted something badly enough to work for it. I can be the owner of my fate.\\nWhy did the author like Cowboy so much in spite of its ugliness?\\nA) Because she loved horses more than anything else.\\nB) Because Cowboy was a strong and smart young horse.\\nC) Because Cowboy had a lot in common with her pony.\\nD) Because she was sad and lonely and needed a companion.","target":"D","rationale":"The author mentions that she was lonely and upset after moving to a new town, her pony being sold, and her parents getting divorced. The passage explains how Cowboy helped the protagonist handle these difficult changes in life by making it easier for them to overcome challenges through their bond with him.\\nSo the answer is D: Because she was sad and lonely and needed a companion."},{"source":"Germany took steps to increase the use of renewable natural resources.

The park, nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, is in the Loyalsock Creek valley on Pennsylvania Route 154, in Forks and Shrewsbury Townships southeast of the borough of Forksville. The name Worlds End has been used since at least 1872, but its origins are uncertain. Although it was founded as Worlds End State Forest Park by Governor Gifford Pinchot in 1932, the park was officially known as Whirls End State Forest Park from 1936 to 1943.The park's land was once home to Native Americans, followed by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially a result of the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\\nA wide variety of wildlife is found in the park, which is also part of an Important Bird Area. Located in the Endless Mountains region of the dissected Allegheny Plateau, Worlds End has a continental climate and rocks and fossils from the Carboniferous period.

By Steven Nelson, Staff Writer | May 22, 2015, at 2:00 p.m. An internal Justice Department document that the ACLU obtained through the Freedom of Information Act shows that, as of 2010, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint did not store the contents of text messages. Verizon did for up to five days, a change from its earlier no-logs-at-all position, and Virgin Mobile kept them for 90 days. The carriers generally kept metadata such as the phone numbers associated with the text for 90 days to 18 months; AT&T was an outlier, keeping it for as long as seven years. An e-mail message from a detective in the Baltimore County Police Department, leaked by Antisec and reproduced in a 2011 Wired article, says that Verizon keeps text message content on their servers for 3-5 days. And: Sprint stores their text message content going back 12 days and Nextel content for 7 days.

Re: How long does Verizon keep records of text messages? viller Aug 22, 2016 10:51 PM (in response to Supergirl1965) Verizon keeps complete conversations forever. A text message is a short, typed message you send or receive on a mobile device. Text messages have a 160-character limit and can contain letters, numbers and special characters, like punctuation marks. They may also include links and emoticons. Verizon ONLY stores your content of your text messages for 5 days to ensure delivery of the messages if you are in a weak signal area. Obviously the writer of this didn't bother to do much research on these areas. Another reason a lot of this information is stored is for technical support purposes.

In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

The primary exposure was the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) and outcome was incident ischemic stroke.   \\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 5,422 participants without a history of stroke at the baseline examination and untreated for sleep apnea were followed for a median of 8.7 years. One hundred ninety-three ischemic strokes were observed. In covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, a significant positive association between ischemic stroke and OAHI was observed in men (P value for linear trend: P = 0.016). Men in the highest OAHI quartile (>19) had an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.86 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-7.4). In the mild to moderate range (OAHI, 5-25), each one-unit increase in OAHI in men was estimated to increase stroke risk by 6% (95% confidence interval, 2-10%). In women, stroke was not significantly associated with OAHI quartiles, but increased risk was observed at an OAHI greater than 25.   \\n CONCLUSIONS The strong adjusted association between ischemic stroke and OAHI in community-dwelling men with mild to moderate sleep apnea suggests that this is an appropriate target for future stroke prevention trials.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence (\\"RATIONALE Although obstructive sleep apnea is associated with physiological perturbations that increase risk of hypertension and are proatherogenic, it is uncertain whether sleep apnea is associated with increased stroke risk in the general population.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River are on the Modoc Plateau; downstream the Pit cuts a canyon through the southern reaches of the Cascades.

These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4]\\n\\nParagraph: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match.

The Eagles looked to improve to 8-1 for the first time since 2004 as they took on the Denver Broncos. The Broncos named Brock Osweiler as their starting quarterback, replacing Trevor Siemian. The Broncos took their only lead of the game on an opening drive that resulted with a Brandon McManus 53 yard field goal. Despite missing tight end Zach Ertz who was out with a hamstring injury, the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat. On their opening drive of the game, Carson Wentz faked a handoff to newly acquired running back Jay Ajayi, and found Alshon Jeffery wide open for a 32-yard touchdown down the right sideline. Later in the first quarter, slot cornerback Patrick Robinson picked off Brock Osweiler on an intended pass to Demaryius Thomas, setting up a Corey Clement 15 yard touchdown reception, on a screen pass. The Eagles responded to another Brandon McManus field goal with a 27-yard touchdown connection between Wentz and tight end Trey Burton. Following McManus' third field goal of the first half, Jay Ajayi found the end zone for the first time with the Eagles, with a 46-yard touchdown run to close the first half. The Eagles led 31-9 at half time, and following a third quarter touchdown run by Corey Clement and touchdown reception by Alshon Jeffery, the Eagles led 44-9. The final score was 51-23, which was virtually a mirror of their last meeting in 2013, and Corey Clement finished the day with three touchdowns (two rushing, one receiving). With the win, the Eagles went into the bye week with the best start since 2004. They had also surpassed their win total from last season where they only got 7 wins. Furthermore; this was the third largest victory at Lincoln Financial Field since the 54-11 win over the Bears in 2013 and the largest victory in the Doug Pederson era.\\nWho made three same plays in the first half","target":"McManus","rationale":"To answer \\"Who made three same plays in the first half\\", we need to check who did what play. It is mentioned that McManus kicked a field goal on an opening drive, which means he made one of those 3 plays at least. However it is not said whether he was responsible for other two kicks or there were others involved as well. Therefore, here's another way to solve this problem: If you don't know how many times each player did something (kick a ball), then assume that they all have done once and find out who has done more than 1 time - In our case; if I assume everyone except Mcmanus only did kick once, then I will get my result because no one else would be able to do things twice or thrice since they are already"},{"source":"Answer based on context:\\n\\nOn Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138. Additionally, his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown, the most in the league. Miller's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season.\\n\\nHow many field goals did Lambo kick in total?","target":"2","rationale":"To answer how many field goals Lambo kicked in total, we need to check when he actually kicked. As mentioned, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers and Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal at first half. At second half, they increased their margin by 22 yards of field goal kicking again. Therefore there are two times that Lambo made a field kick during this game."},{"source":"One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ).

Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 , rather than the formal surrender of Japan, which was on 2 September 1945 that officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post-World War II issues.

Nick has escaped from prison, where he was serving 25 years for the heist, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral a week earlier. Nick, however, says he is innocent and reveals that Englander used to employ cops to protect his multi-floor jewelry business. One day, while Nick was escorting Englander and the diamond, he was knocked unconscious by two men in ski masks. He awakened to find that Englander had framed him for stealing the diamond in order to get the insurance money, as he had lost his fortune during the stock market crisis.Unbeknownst to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) break into Englander's upper floor jewelry vault in the building across the street to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence.

This would potentially be most useful in triple negative BC (TNBC), where better therapies are still needed. The assessment of AR status is generally performed on the primary tumor even if the tumor has already metastasized. Very little is known regarding discrepancies of AR status during tumor progression. To determine the prevalence of AR positivity, with emphasis on TNBCs, and to investigate AR status during tumor progression, we evaluated a large series of primary BCs and matching metastases and recurrences.', 'AR status was performed on 356 primary BCs, 135 matching metastases, and 12 recurrences using a next-generation Tissue Microarray (ngTMA). A commercially available AR antibody was used to determine AR-status by immunohistochemistry. AR positivity was defined as any nuclear staining in tumor cells ≥1 %. AR expression was correlated with pathological tumor features of the primary tumor. Additionally, the concordance rate of AR expression between the different tumor sites was determined.', 'AR status was positive in: 87 % (307/353) of primary tumors, 86.1 % (105/122) of metastases, and in 66.7 % (8/12) of recurrences. TNBC tested positive in 11.4 %, (4/35) of BCs. A discrepant result was seen in 4.3 % (5/117) of primary BC and matching lymph node (LN) metastases. Three AR negative primary BCs were positive in the matching LN metastasis, representing 17.6 % of all negative BCs with lymph node metastases (3/17). Two AR positive primary BCs were negative in the matching LN metastasis, representing 2.0 % of all AR positive BCs with LN metastases (2/100). No discrepancies were seen between primary BC and distant metastases or recurrence (n\\\\u2009=\\\\u200917).\\nAnswer: Most primary (87 %) and metastasized (86.1 %) BCs are AR positive including a significant fraction of TNBCs (11.4 %). Further, AR status is highly conserved during tumor progression and a change only occurs in a small fraction (4.1 %). Our study supports the notion that targeting AR could be effective for many BC patients and that re-testing of AR status in formerly negative or mixed type BC's is recommended.","target":"Is androgen receptor status highly conserved during tumor progression of breast cancer?","rationale":"The answer to the given question is Yes.

Although it is established that neutrophils are derived from the granulocyte‐macrophage progenitor (GMP), the differentiation pathways from GMP to functional mature neutrophils are poorly defined. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and cell‐cycle‐based analysis, we identified three neutrophil subsets within the BM: a committed proliferative neutrophil precursor (preNeu) which differentiates into non‐proliferating immature neutrophils and mature neutrophils. Transcriptomic profiling and functional analysis revealed that preNeu require the C/EBP&egr; transcription factor for their generation from the GMP, and their proliferative program is substituted by a gain of migratory and effector function as they mature. preNeus expand under microbial and tumoral stress, and immature neutrophils are recruited to the periphery of tumor‐bearing mice. In summary, our study identifies specialized BM granulocytic populations that ensure supply under homeostasis and stress responses. Graphical Abstract Figure. No Caption available.

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century.\\nLongacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844.\\nIn Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.\\nIn 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

They both get lots of snow during winter, but the lake effect snow which adds feet of snow to the yearly total, lingers much longer on the eastern side of the lake.\\n\\nHint: Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.[1]\\n\\nThe same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.","target":"Trip","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that the lake effect snow lingers longer on the eastern side of the lake. Lake-effect snow is produced when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer water, which then rises up through the colder air and freezes into precipitation.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\\n\\n(The authors did not find any difference in costs which could explain the result.) Another example is Sen et al. who found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted price ceilings. Another example is the Supreme Court of Pakistan decision regarding fixing a ceiling price for sugar at PKR45/kg. Price Ceilings. A price ceiling is the opposite of a price floor: It's a government-mandated maximum price for a good or service. As economists Paul Krugman and Robin Wells note in their basic text Microeconomics, price ceilings are far less common than price floors in the modern U.S. economy. Still, there are some. Rent-control law in New York and other major cities is an example of price ceilings. Price Floors When a price floor is set, a certain minimum amount must be paid for a good or service. If the price floor is below a market price, no direct effect occurs. If the market price is lower than the price floor, then a surplus will be generated. Minimum wage laws are good examples of price floors. In many states, the U.S. minimum wage law has no effect, as market wage rates for low-skilled workers are above the U.S. minimum wage rate. Difference Between Price Ceilings and Price Floor Both price ceilings and floors are forms of price controls. While a price ceiling dictates the maximum price of a good or service, a price floor refers to the lowest price for which a good or service may be sold. If the price ceiling is set below the market price, then a shortage is created; the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. The shortage may be resolved in many ways. One way is queuing; people have to wait in line for the product, and only those willing to wait in line for the product will actually get it. Key points. Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. A price ceiling is a government-imposed price control, or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments use price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation, in the event of an investment bubble, or in the event of monopoly ownership of a product, all of which can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing, leading to shortages. Furth Price ceiling is a measure of price control imposed by the government on particular commodities in order to prevent consumers from being charged high prices. Price ceiling can also be understood as a legal maximum price set by the government on particular goods and services to make those commodities attainable to all consumers. Answers to Self-Check Questions. 1  A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage. 2  A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. A price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product.[1] A price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price in order to be effective.

As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council.

The last cycle ended about 4 years ago.\\n\\n2 years ago I started a relationship with (27F) that I met earlier in that year while studying to increase my chance of employment. She approached me; I wasn't ready for a relationship but she had the same condition (not as severe) and needed to fix things too so I told her we'd do it together.\\n\\nWhen we met she thought she might be asexual but had a lot of trauma. She did increase the frequency, but we still disagree on it. There tends to be a week with 3x and then not as much the rest of each month (she tracks it, but I think it's less than it says). I'd like it to be 2-3 each week and think it's just a matter of effort; if she loved me it'd come naturally. \\n\\nShe also has issues with anxiety and depression. I've been depressed too and I think she just needs to get outside and do things more often to get better, but she says she's comfortable at the computer, knitting (what 20 year old knits?) or drawing/colouring in (which is childish and needs to stop). \\n\\nIn the last 10 months she went through a lot of therapy, got a job in the field we studied and was promoted at the end of her probation. She moved far away to do that (which I encouraged) and she's been asking me to move with her, but I don't want to lose my financial independence by moving before I have a job. I also don't want to limit myself to looking for work near her because there's not as much there, so I'm looking around back home.\\n\\nThe other thing is that she's ticked off all these goals (she's got the job, the house, the car) but she's not exactly happy. If I have to live with her moods wings or misery that would just drag me down and I can't have that because my life is about to improve so much. \\n\\nA few days ago she was trying to ask me when I'd be willing to move in (yet again) and I wouldn't commit to a date so she said she was done even though I tried explaining why I couldn't commit yet and that I do love her. The next day she asked for keys back/where to send my things and I asked her what was going on. She called me and I told her I thought we needed a cooling off period in case we changed our minds. I told her she has to be happier if she wants me to move in and she asked how she's supposed to demonstrate that.

They assume their girlfriend should only be happy if she ticks off all her goals, but since she's already done so, it doesn't seem like there's anything else for her to focus on except pleasing the boyfriend - which involves sending him photos of herself smiling all the time. This could indicate a controlling nature in which he wants his partner to behave in a particular way regardless of what makes sense for themselves or what makes them feel good as individuals.\\\\nIn addition, he expects his partner's mental health problems (anxiety/depression) can simply be fixed by smiling and being cheerful (which seems unrealistic), while ignoring her feelings or needs because they don't fit into his plans or desires for how things should go between them (in terms of emotional intimacy). He doesn't seem interested in trying to see where she may be coming from when expressing concerns about their relationship (such as needing more affection) or trying to understand why this might be difficult at times due to anxiety/depression; instead he just thinks she needs \\\\\\"to get outside\\\\\\" rather than recognizing this isn't always easy when experiencing mental health issues.\\\\nBased on these observations, it seems likely that most of the problems here are originating with the author alone - therefore I think this post belongs in category \\"AUTHOR\\".\\""},{"source":"Given a paragraph and a claim, classify it this way: If the claim contradicts the evidence present in the paragraph, classify the claim as '0'.

At least a dozen petrochemical, fertilizer and refinery projects, with combined capacity to produce more than 5 million tonnes a year of products, have hit the buffers or been delayed due to water supply problems, according to a Reuters assessment. The list was compiled based on reports in state media, direct comments from project managers involved in several of the delayed plants, traders, and details published by some of the companies or major shareholders in the developments. Reuters sought comment from investors or companies involved. Most did not respond to emailed requests, while two confirmed water shortages were a major issue. One denied there was any problem, although a trader with close links to the project flagged a lack of water supplies as a crucial factor. Fasa Petrochemical Company and Darab Petrochemical Company, which each own 30% in Firouzabad Petrochemical Company, did not respond to requests for comment. “Many of these projects were proposed by lawmakers who were trying to create jobs in their constituencies. Unfortunately the technical studies have been widely ignored,” said Reza Banimahd, a businessman in Tehran who has worked on refinery projects. The water shortage is one of many challenges facing Tehran as it seeks to skirt U.S. sanctions by ramping up production of products, which are more difficult to trace back to Iran than Iranian crude, which has clearly identifiable characteristics. Under sanctions, crude exports have plunged 80% and are now worth about $700 million a month - a calculation based on Iran’s normal selling price although under sanctions Iran tends to sell crude at a discount. By comparison, Tehran has kept oil product sales at about $500 million a month, Reuters calculations show. Graphic: Iranian fuel oil exports, here  Oil refineries and other processing plants need water mainly for cooling. Producing a single gallon of gasoline requires 0.61–0.71 of a gallon of water. But diverting limited supplies away from farming towards industry carries political risks. Drought and depleting water supplies have sparked unrest. Farmers in Iran's central region protested here in several cities in 2018 over water mismanagement, as rainfall dropped 25% below the average. The plant in Firouzabad, an inland area in the parched south of the country, aimed to produce 1 million tonnes of ethylene a year. Based on figures for a similar capacity plant, that output would use more than 2 million tonnes of water a year. The government, which worries about falling national groundwater levels, wants the $500 million plant moved to the coast where desalinated water could be used. But local officials and a senior cleric have objected and the project has stalled. Azizollah Hashemizadeh, Firouzabad’s Friday prayer leader who reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top authority in Iran’s theocratic system, said in June the project would bring prosperity and could not be shifted. While Khamenei has the last word in state affairs, there are a range of parallel institutions below him that often compete for influence. For example, the Revolutionary Guards, an investor in the Firouzabad plant, has a separate command structure to the conventional army and has vast industrial interests. The Revolutionary Guards did not respond to a request for comment sent via their website. The structure of rival power centers often creates a tortured decision-making process and can push aside commercial and environmental factors. “There is a problem with coordination between ministries over development plans,” said Kaveh Madani, a former Iranian deputy vice president for the environment and now visiting professor at London’s Imperial College, adding that sanctions had pushed the government to prioritize jobs over water and the environment. The delay in the Firouzabad plant has had knock on effects, disrupting four other projects that aimed to use the facility’s output of ethylene, an ingredient used to make products such as polyester resins and adhesives. Those offtake plants would also have added to strains on the region’s scant water reserves. “Delay is not a good word. After 12 years, we are practically facing a failed project,” said another project manager for the Firouzabad plant when contacted by Reuters. Asking not to be identified, he said the proposed new coastal site was empty, flattened but with nothing yet built. Despite the challenges, Iran has boosted refining capacity, announcing in February it was self sufficient in gasoline. Iran’s petrochemical plants have capacity to make about 65 million tonnes of products a year, of which about 22.5 million tonnes is exported. The government aims to increase output to 91 million tonnes in two years and 130 million tonnes in five years. Iran’s refining capacity stands at about 2.23 million barrels per day, putting it behind regional leader Saudi Arabia. Graphic: Middle East refining capacities (2018), here  Social Security Investment Company, a state body with 200 subsidiaries and major energy investments, flagged problems facing the industry in a 2018 report including sanctions and “the drought and shortage of water for the inland refineries.”  It said some projects “were not economically feasible as they were initiated to create jobs in unsuitable locations.”  In northeast Iran, Khorasan Petrochemical Company has struggled to launch a fertilizer plant to produce 660,000 tonnes of urea, using gas as a feedstock. Five years on, the project is at a standstill despite securing $700 million in state support. “Water resources for the project have not been provided and remain unclear,” Tamin Petroleum and Petrochemical Investment Company (TAPPICO), a major shareholder, wrote on its website. Agriculture, a major employer in Iran, accounts for about 90% of Iran’s water usage, with industry using 10%. But any extra demand strains Iran’s depleting reserves. U.N. data indicate Iran is using 3.8 billion cubic meters of water a year more than is replaced, leading to a fast falling water table. Nevertheless, some projects still go ahead even in areas where strains are acute. Shazand refinery in central Iran had to drill deep wells to pump groundwater, state news agency IRNA reported in 2018, alarming environmentalists and sapping supplies from farmers. When asked to comment, Shazand Petrochemical Company pointed to a statement published on its website that was published after Reuters made the request: “To reduce consumption of groundwater, the company has planned to use the reservoir of Kamal Saleh dam - when it is full - and wastewater of neighboring cities.”  The company said it was seeking a contractor for its water recycling project.

Passage:The Adult Entertainment Association of Canada (abbreviated AEAC, also called the Adult Association of Canada) is a coalition of strip club owners and their agents that represents 53 of the 140 strip clubs in Ontario, Canada. Tim Lambrinos is the organization's director. The Exotic Dancers' Alliance (EDA), a collective that was founded in 1995 to bring together both former and current strippers and their supporters, sought to establish minimum employment standards for strippers in Ontario by contending with the AEAC, but the EDA ceased to exist in 2004. Also in 2004, Ottawa instituted a law against lap dancing, and the AEAC unsuccessfully attempted to have the law overturned in 2007. Starting in 2004, the AEAC and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada became embroiled in a long-standing controversy about work permits for foreign workers to be hired for the purpose of striptease. In 2008, when Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley allegedly received threats from sex industry officials in relation to her support of Bill C-17, which sought to allow immigration officers to deny temporary visas to prospective strippers if they were suspected to be sex trafficking victims, Lambrinos said that \\"it's not plausible\\" that any of the AEAC strip clubs were responsible for the threats. In 2009, the AEAC invited Toronto City Council members to attend a free lunch at a strip club in the city, and three councillors accepted the invitation. The AEAC released a statement in 2010 that the government's crackdown on sex industry worker visas had resulted in a stripper shortage, and Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews responded by saying that the strip clubs that were short on strippers because of the crackdown were engaging in human trafficking. Toews then ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the relevant strip clubs in order to determine whether or not the strippers working there were illegal immigrants or sex trafficking victims, and the AEAC launched a campaign to deny these allegations.","target":"Also in 2004, Ottawa instituted a law against lap dancing, and the AEAC unsuccessfully attempted to have the law overturned in 2007","rationale":"The answer to the question can be inferred by using the sentence \\"Also in 2004, Ottawa instituted a law against lap dancing, and the AEAC unsuccessfully attempted to have the law overturned in 2007\\", since it indicates that 'Ottawa' instituted a law against lap dancing in 2004.\\n \\n</pre>"},{"source":"Is the premise \\"A laughing woman leans on the legs of a sitting man while lying on a bed of pebbles.\\" true if \\"A woman sits alone.\\"?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The premise is referring to a scene that includes two people, not just one.

Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.\\nOur setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk, previous thyroidectomy, or refusal to be operated on.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then once a year.   \\n RESULTS 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I, 12 with two doses, and one with four doses. In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 (interquartile range 50-106) ml to 29 (23-48) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up. The median reduction was 40 (22-48) ml (60% reduction, p < 0.0001), half of which occurred within three months. Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume. Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism (cumulative five year risk 22%, 95% confidence interval 4.8% to 38.4%). Side effects were few: three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis. Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result; she was referred for operation six months after treatment.   \\n CONCLUSIONS A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre.","target":"Radioiodine treatment of multinodular non-toxic goitre","rationale":"Radioiodine treatment of multinodular non-toxic goitre is a reasonable summary for the abstract as it summarizes most of the important points."},{"source":"In this task, you are given dialogue, and you have to find the most critical location in the given conversation.\\n\\nHello, can you tell me about Eswatini geography \\n Hello and yes.

Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively. In combinations, buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in Maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition. Subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation. Increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone.

In the course of the nineteenth century the Flemish movement stood up for the rights of Dutch, mostly called Flemish. But in competing with the French language the variation in dialects was a serious disadvantage. Since standardisation is a lengthy process, Dutch-speaking Belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. Therefore, the situation in Belgium is essentially no different from that in the Netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard British and standard American English.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.\\nQuestion: social dynamics cause frustration in the organization when\\nAnswer:","target":"The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership","rationale":"The question asks why social dynamics cause frustration in an organization. The context discusses how the hierarchy of companies often does not reflect reality, as junior-level employees can have a lot of influence and value. However, there is friction because \\"the divide between senior leadership and folks on the ground widens\\" which leads to resentment among workers about their lack of control over major decisions that affect them. This creates tension within organizations that would otherwise be productive places to work where all members feel engaged with what they are doing by having input into organizational matters.\\nSo based on this information, the answer should be: “The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership”"},{"source":"In this task you will be given a string of characters.

As part-time music minister of the church, Greg Tenorly sat in his usual place on the podium, behind and slightly to the left of the pastor. He wondered why attendance was up. It was a perfect day--seventy degrees, sunny. That had to be part of the reason. And the sermon title was 'Forgiveness Fighters.' People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage.\\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother?\\nMaybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened.

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th.

Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him.

González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.

Brought up in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga says that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga described her high school self as \\"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\\" but also \\"a bit insecure\\". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for \\"being either too provocative or too eccentric\\".Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become \\"a cultured young woman\\". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. As a teenager, she played at open mic nights. Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls and Philia in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at a nearby boys' high school.

In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn.

We uncovered a decrease in the in vitro formation of spectrin-actin complex in the absence (50%) or presence (60%) of protein 4.1. Actual formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex fell in a linear fashion during the storage period. This fall in spectrin-actin interaction tightly correlated with the decline in total red cell phospholipid (R = 0.9932) measured simultaneously. This decrement of spectrin-actin association could be restored to greater than 70% of normal values by preincubation of stored spectrin with 50 mM dithiothreitol.

In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 16-yard TD pass to TE Martellus Bennett, along with RB Marion Barber getting a 2-yard TD run.  The Seahawks would respond with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 44-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Dallas answered with Romo completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten, while Folk got a 41-yard field goal.  Seattle would close out the half with Mare making a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Seahawks tried to rally as Mare made a 25-yard field goal.  The Cowboys replied with Romo completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas closed out the game with Folk nailing a 42-yard field goal.

The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin.

The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. \\n\\n- Analog television (or analogue television) is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio.

File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of storage, transmission and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on computer networks, World Wide Web-based hyperlinked documents, and the use of distributed peer-to-peer networking.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- The mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

Anderson . It explores the idea that the traditional mass media in the United States are biased towards liberals , but through new media , such as the Internet , cable television , and talk radio , conservatives are slowly gaining some power in the world of information . The name South Park Conservatives derives from Andrew Sullivan 's term , \`\` South Park Republican '' .\\n\\n- Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.\\n\\n- Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to\\nelectrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS).\\n\\n- Eric Theodore Cartman is one of the main characters in the animated television series \\"South Park\\", created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and voiced by Trey Parker. Cartman, generally referred to by his surname, is one of four central characters in \\"South Park\\", along with his friends Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick. Cartman first appeared, originally named Kenny, in prototypical form in a 1992 animated short \\"Jesus vs. Frosty\\", and a 1995 animated short \\"Jesus vs. Santa\\", and first appeared on television in the pilot episode of \\"South Park\\", \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", on August 13, 1997.\\n\\n- Andrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is an English-born American author, editor, and blogger.

He announced his retirement from blogging in 2015.\\n\\n- Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced ), is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.\\nCoaxial cable differs from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.\\n\\n- Mass communication is the study of how people and entities relay information through mass media to large segments of the population at the same time. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood to relate newspaper, magazine, and book publishing, as well as radio, television and film, even via internet as these mediums are used for disseminating information, news and advertising. Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as interpersonal communication or organizational communication, in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the behavior, attitude, opinion, or emotion of the person or people receiving the information.\\n\\n- A blog (a truncation of the expression weblog) is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (\\"posts\\"). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, \\"multi-author blogs\\" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \\"microblogging\\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. \\"Blog\\" can also be used as a verb, meaning \\"to maintain or add content to a blog\\".\\n\\n- Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text which the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail (also called StretchText). Hyper<wbr>text documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress sequence or by touching the screen. Apart from text, the term \\"hyper<wbr>text\\" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content forms with integrated hyperlinks. Hyper<wbr>text is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'south park conservatives' with the relationship of 'genre'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - adult\\n - animal\\n - animated sitcom\\n - book\\n - comedy\\n - communication\\n - culture\\n - design\\n - dialogue\\n - diary\\n - dramatic\\n - education\\n - entertainment\\n - family\\n - game\\n - government\\n - information\\n - magazine\\n - markup language\\n - mass\\n - middle of the road\\n - music\\n - musical\\n - news\\n - politics\\n - radio\\n - research\\n - review\\n - science\\n - share\\n - social media\\n - society\\n - study\\n - television\\n - variety\\n - various\\n - video\\n - war\\n - web browser\\n - western","target":"politics","rationale":"The topic of the book relates to politics as it explores how people with conservative views are fighting against what they believe is a liberal bias in traditional media."},{"source":"In this task, you will be given a debate topic, along with a sentence from the debate.

However, identification of infectious agents in severe pneumonia remains a major challenge so far. In this study, the potential utility of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in detecting nonbacterial pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia was retrospectively evaluated. Materials and Methods: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia at our hospital from September 2015 to December 2017 were included, and their baseline clinical characteristics were collected. Nonbacterial infectious agents detected by TEM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serological tests were summarized. The detection rates were further compared between TEM and serological tests. Results: BALF examination under the transmission electron microscope revealed 24 viruses, 16 mycoplasmas, 18 chlamydia, 2 fungi and 74 bacteria in 99 samples, among which 61 samples were mixed infections. The combined use of serological tests and TEM significantly improved the detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents in patients with severe pneumonia. Conclusions: Our data support that implementation of TEM could improve the sensitivity for detecting viruses, atypical pathogens and mixed infections in BALF from patient of severe pneumonia. Therefore, TEM may be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method of other microbiological tests in severe pneumonia. \\n Title: Transmission Electron Microscopy Improves the Diagnostic Sensitivity in Nonbacterial Etiology of Severe Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study","target":"True","rationale":"The title should provide evidence for the usefulness of transmission electron microscopy in identifying nonbacterial pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.\\n\\n- Lviv (',   ', ; Yiddish: ; Latin: \\"Leopolis\\"), the largest city in western Ukraine and the seventh largest city in the country overall, is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine.

From 1434, it was the regional capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland and was known as Lwów. In 1772, after the First partition of Poland, the city became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and was renamed to Lemberg. In 1918 in a short time was the capital of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was known again as Lwów and was the centre of the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic.

This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation.\\n\\n- Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.\\n\\n- World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- Lwów Voivodeship was an administrative unit of interwar Poland (19181939).

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.\\n\\n- Aleksandr Tuchkin ( born July 15 , 1964 in Lviv , Ukrainian SSR ) is a Russian team handball player and Olympic champion from 2000 in Sydney .

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is a national constituent of the worldwide Olympic movement. Subject to the controls of the International Olympic Committee, NOCs are responsible for organizing their people's participation in the Olympic Games. They may nominate cities within their respective areas as candidates for future Olympic Games. NOCs also promote the development of athletes and training of coaches and officials at a national level within their geographies.\\n\\n- Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf.\\n\\n- Casimir III the Great (30 April 1310  5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to 1370.

A record 197 nations, all current IOC member nations, took part in the Games, comprising 10,318 athletes. The International Olympic Committee voted in 1986 to separate the Summer and Winter Games, which had been held in the same year since 1924, and place them in alternating even-numbered years, beginning in 1994. The 1996 Summer Games were the first to be staged in a different year from the Winter Games. Atlanta became the fifth American city to host the Olympic Games and the third to hold a Summer Olympic Games. \\n\\n- Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.\\n\\n- The West Ukrainian People's Republic was a short-lived republic that existed in late 1918 and early 1919 in eastern Galicia. It included the cities of Lviv, Przemyl, Kolomyia and Stanislaviv (now Ivano-Frankivsk) and claimed parts of Bukovina and Carpathian Ruthenia. Politically, the Ukrainian National Democratic Party (the precursor of the interwar Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance) dominated the lrgislative assembly, guided by varying degrees of Greek Catholic, liberal and socialist ideology. Other parties represented included the Ukrainian Radical Party and the Christian Social Party.\\n\\n- The Second Polish Republic, also known as the Second Commonwealth of Poland or interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (19181939).

It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west.\\n\\n- Daniel of Galicia (1201  1264; : \\"Danylo Romanovych (Halytskyi)\\"; : \\"Daniil Romanovich (Galitsky)\\") was a King of Rus', Prince (Knyaz) of Galicia (\\"Halych\\") (12051255), Peremyshl (1211), and Volodymyr (12121231).

The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter.\\n\\n- A near-Earth object (NEO) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth. By definition, a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit (AU). NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), more than one hundred near-Earth comets (NECs), and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids, large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth. It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth. NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose, and mitigations are being researched.

Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots.

Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background.

Permanent wilting leads to plant death. Symptoms of wilting and blights resemble one another.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Jim had a small veggie garden that he planted every year. His brother Rob had a similar patch, and he was also a gardener. The plants in Jim's garden started wilting at some point and he found out that his soil had high salinity and some harmful bacteria that wiled the plants indirectly.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro.

While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win.

They are the largest of the three classes of elements. In fact, most elements are metals. Look back at the modern periodic table (Figure 6.3) in this chapters lesson \\"How Elements Are Organized.\\" Find the metals in the table. They are all the elements that are color-coded blue. Examples include sodium (Na), silver (Ag), and zinc (Zn). Metals have relatively high melting points, so almost all are solids at room temperature. The only exception is mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Most metals are also good conductors of heat. Thats why they are used for cooking pots and stovetops. Metals have other characteristic properties as well. Most are shiny, ductile, and malleable. These properties are illustrated in Figure 6.5. You can dig deeper into the properties of metals at this URL: Nonmetals are elements that do not conduct electricity. They are the second largest class of elements. Find the nonmetals in Figure 6.3. They are all the elements on the right side of the table that are color-coded green. Examples of nonmetals include helium (He), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). Nonmetals generally have properties that are the opposite of those of metals. They also tend to vary more in their properties than metals do. For example, nonmetals have relatively low boiling points, so many of them are gases at room temperature. But several nonmetals are solids, including carbon and phosphorus (P). One nonmetal, bromine (Br), is a liquid at room temperature. Generally, nonmetals are also poor conductors of heat. In fact, they may be used for insulation. For example, the down filling in a down jacket is mostly air, which consists mainly of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O). These nonmetal gases are poor conductors of heat, so they keep body heat in and cold air out. Solid nonmetals are dull rather than shiny. They are also brittle rather than ductile or malleable. You can see examples of solid nonmetals in Figure 6.6. You can learn more about specific nonmetals with the interactive table at this URL: [Link] Metalloids are elements that fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. Just seven elements are metalloids, so they are the smallest class of elements. In Figure 6.3, they are color-coded orange. Examples of metalloids include boron (B), silicon (Si), and germanium (Ge). Metalloids have some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals. For example, many metalloids can conduct electricity but only at certain temperatures. These metalloids are called semiconductors. Silicon is an example. It is used in computer chips. It is also the most common metalloid on Earth. It is shiny like a metal but brittle like a nonmetal. You see a sample of silicon in Figure 6.7. The figure also shows other examples of metalloids. You can learn more about the properties of metalloids at this URL: [Link] From left to right across the periodic table, each element has one more proton than the element to its left. Because atoms are always electrically neutral, for each added proton, one electron is also added. Electrons are added first to the lowest energy level possible until that level is full. Only then are electrons added to the next higher energy level. The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure 6.8 as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.

In 1980, 89,538 U.S. registered nurses who were 34 to 59 years of age and had no history of cancer completed a previously validated dietary questionnaire designed to measure individual consumption of total fat, saturated fat, linoleic acid, and cholesterol, as well as other nutrients. In a subsample of 173 participants studied in detail, those in the highest quintile of fat intake consumed a mean of 44 percent of calories from fat, as compared with 32 percent for those in the lowest quintile. During four years of follow-up, 601 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed among the 89,538 nurses in the study. After adjustment for known determinants in multivariate analyses, the relative risk of breast cancer among women in the highest quintile of calorie-adjusted total fat intake, as compared with women in the lowest quintile, was 0.82 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.64 and 1.05). The corresponding relative risks were 0.84 (confidence limits, 0.66 and 1.08) for saturated fat, 0.88 (0.69 and 1.12) for linoleic acid, and 0.91 (0.70 and 1.18) for cholesterol intake. Similar results were found for both postmenopausal and premenopausal women. These data are based on a limited period of follow-up and do not exclude a possible influence of fat intake before adulthood or at levels lower than 30 percent of calories. They suggest, however, that a moderate reduction in fat intake by adult women is unlikely to result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of breast cancer.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The paper summarizes research about the effects of dietary fat intake on breast cancer in women. Most importantly, the study focuses on women who are between 34 and 59 years old and have no history of cancer. This means that most participants are adults (aged 18 years or older). Another important aspect of this study is that it examines the effect of reducing fat intake among adult women, rather than examining whether a moderate increase in fat intake can result in an increased incidence of breast cancer.

The harder they push together, the farther apart they move; this occurs because both forces are directly proportional to the distance between them (i.e., if you increase or decrease any variable - either pushing strength or length traveled away from each other- it will affect all three variables). As a result, decreasing the push causes less energy to be transferred into motion which results in shorter distances traveled away from each other for both skaters. Therefore decreases."},{"source":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the park in which imported northwestern wolves were reintroduced?\\n\\nStarting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of \\"destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry\\" on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the coyote then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.\\nBy the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.","target":"Yellowstone","rationale":"The article mentions wolves were reintroduced into a park.

At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

The amplified PCR products of TGEV HB06 were cloned, sequenced, and compared with other TGEV strains genes selected from the GenBank. Then, the recombinant fragment in pMD18-T was subcloned into corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI to construct a recombinant fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-M. Then, the verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3), and the expression of M fusion protein was induced by using isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) as inducer. The results showed that the gene fragment of M at a length of 789 bp was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully, and sequence comparison with that reported in GenBank revealed that the M gene complete sequence shares more than 94% homology in nucleotide. The result of SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant membrane protein had a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa, which was the same as the expected results. It was proven by Western blotting that the recombinant membrane protein had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody. Therefore, the expressed fusion protein has a good antigenicity. This work established a good foundation for further studies on the production of anti-TGEV vaccines.","target":"Cloning and expression of the membrane protein gene of TGEV HB06 strain","rationale":"In this study, the gene fragment of TGEV HB06 membrane protein was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully.

In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.\\n\\n- The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .\\n\\n- The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.\\n\\n- A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area.\\n\\n- The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.\\n\\n- Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.\\n\\n- Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.\\n\\n- Phil Macpherson CBE ( 16 October 1903 -- 2 March 1981 ) also known as GPS Macpherson was a Scottish rugby union footballer who played for Scotland in 26 Tests between 1922 and 1932 . Macpherson was born in Newtonmore in Badenoch , Scotland and attended Fettes College in Edinburgh . From there he attended Oxford University . It was at Oxford that his rugby talents saw him selected for Oxford University RFC . It was from there he was first selected for Scotland in 1922 when he played in all four of Scotland 's Five Nations matches . He next played for Scotland in 1924 , and scored his first international try against Wales on 2 February that year . He only played one other international that year -- a Calcutta Cup match against England national rugby union team . The following year Macpherson was selected as Scotland 's captain . As captain , he took Scotland to their first ever Five Nations Grand Slam -- that is , wins over England , Wales , Ireland and France in one season . The first match of the season was against France at Inverleith on 25 January . MacPherson was one of the most influential members of the team that eventually won 25 -- 4 . Scotland 's next match was against Wales in which Macpherson also played . The match was played away in Swansea and Scotland eventually won 24 -- 14 after leading 24 -- 5 at one point . Macpherson did not play against Ireland , where Scotland still won 14 -- 8 . MacPherson returned for Scotland 's last match of the tournament against England . The match was played at Murrayfield Stadium which had just been completed . It was played in front on 70,000 spectators . After trailing England 11 -- 5 , Scotland scored a try that involved several players , including Macpherson to reduce the deficit to 11 -- 10 . After a drop goal Scotland took a 14 -- 11 lead .

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.\\n\\n- The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.

This was the first matchup between Rodgers and Brady, as Rodgers missed the 2010 contest at Gillette Stadium with a concussion. On the opening drive of the game, the Packers drove all the way to the Patriots 14, but the Patriots red zone defense continued to stay hot and forced them to settle for a 32-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. After a Patriots punt, the Packers, aided by a 33-yard completion from Rodgers to Davante Adams, reached the Patriots 17, but once again the Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone and Mason Crosby kicked a 35-yard field goal, increasing the Packers lead to 6-0. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Packers stormed 85 yards in only 4 plays with Rodgers finding Richard Rodgers deep for a 45-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 13-0. After a terrible first quarter, the Patriots got things going on their next drive. On the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady darted a pass to Gronkowski for a 29-yard gain to the Packers 41. Three plays later Brandon Bolden scampered for a 6-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 13-7. The Patriots defense responded by getting the Packers to a 3rd-and-5, but no pass rush allowed Rodgers 14 seconds to find Randall Cobb for a 33-yard gain to the Patriots 34. The Packers reached the Patriots 6, but Hightower sacked Rodgers for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-and-goal, and Crosby kicked a 33-yard field goal with just under six minutes remaining in the first half. Down 16-7, Brady drove the Patriots back down the field again on an 80-yard drive, finding LaFell in the back of the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown pass, trimming the score to 16-14. However, 1:05 would prove to be too much time for Aaron Rodgers. After an incompletion to Adams, Rodgers threw a screen pass to James Starks who took it 28 yards to the Packers 47. An 8-yard completion to Jordy Nelson moved the ball to the Patriots 45. Two plays later, Rodgers hit Nelson in stride, who outran Revis and McCourty, for a 45-yard touchdown with 00:14 remaining in the first half, increasing the lead to 23-14. That was only the 2nd touchdown Revis allowed all season. The third quarter was a stalemate, as both defenses began to take over and neither team scored. The Patriots took over with 2:21 remaining in the third and constructed a 9 play, 78-yard drive with Brady throwing a laser to LaFell for a 15-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, pulling the Patriots within two, 23-21. The Packers countered, reaching the Patriots 10, but Adams dropped a sure touchdown on a wide-open slant on 3rd-and-5, but Crosby kicked a 28-yard field goal, making the score 26-21 with 8:41 remaining. On their next drive, Brady converted a 4th-and-3 to Edelman at their own 49, and two plays later converted a 3rd-and-7 with a 10-yard pass to Gronkowski. Three plays later, Brady dropped a pass into the arms of Rob Gronkowski who caught the ball momentarily, but Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix punched it out before it could be ruled a catch, wiping out a touchdown. On the very next play, Mike Daniels and Mike Neal combined to sack Brady for a 9-yard loss. Instead of calling a timeout Gostkowski was sent out on the field for a 47-yard field goal attempt with the clock running to preserve a timeout at the two-minute warning, but Gostkowski missed the hurried field goal attempt, keeping the score 26-21 with just 2:40 remaining. The Patriots forced a 3rd-and-4, but Rodgers converted it with a 7-yard pass to Cobb, enabling the Packers to run out the clock and win the game. The Patriots fell to 9-3 with the loss, snapping their 7-game winning streak. The Patriots looked nothing like the team that had won 7 straight games, struggling in all facets of the game. Tom Brady was 22 of 35 for 245 yards 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Patriots managed 84 yards rushing, but only carried the ball 19 times.  Rob Gronkowski was the receiving star for the Patriots with 7 catches for 98 yards.  Aaron Rodgers, continuing his home dominance, turned in another great performance, completing 24 of 38 passes for 368 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, benefiting from the Patriots almost non-existent pass rush. They managed three sacks, but couldn't get any consistent pressure. Meanwhile, Eddie Lacy had 98 yards on 21 carries.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.  Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators.  Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low  magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.  \\nWaddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search.

Passage:Mormon fiction is fiction by or about members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also called Mormons or Latter-day Saints (LDS). Its history is commonly divided into four sections as first organized by Eugene England. During the first fifty years of the church's existence, 1830–1880, fiction was not popular, though Parley P. Pratt wrote a fictional Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil. With the emergence of the novel and short stories as popular reading material, Orson F. Whitney called on fellow members to write inspirational stories. During the home literature movement, church-published magazines published many didactic stories and Nephi Anderson wrote the novel Added Upon. The generation of writers after the home literature movement produced fiction that was recognized nationally but was seen as rebelling against home literature's outward moralization. Vardis Fisher's Children of God and Maurine Whipple's The Giant Joshua were prominent novels from this time period. In the 1970s and 1980s, authors starting writing realistic fiction as faithful Mormons. Acclaimed examples include Levi S. Peterson's The Backslider and Linda Sillitoe's Sideways to the Sun. Home literature experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s when church-owned Deseret Book started to publish more fiction, including Gerald Lund's historical fiction series The Work and the Glory and Jack Weyland's novels.\\n Links: a.

The bark protects the tree from being burned directly by fire and also acts as a heat shield, preventing the intense flames from reaching all parts of the trunk.\\nThick leaves would be counterproductive because it increases surface area which in turn means more exposure to burning embers hitting them or other objects falling on them (like branches). \\nLarge roots are not relevant here since they're underground and protected so long as there's no erosion caused by rain washing away dirt around the base of trees during fires. \\nTrees with thin trunks should burn easily if exposed to direct flame while those with very large ones should topple over when weakened due to an excessively high temperature causing their structure to become unstable\\n\\n\\n'''"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a news headline in English.

The authors recently identified three common haplotypes in the GNAS gene encoding Gαs, with the greatest Gαs protein expression and signal transduction in haplotype *3 carriers and less in haplotype *2 and *1 carriers. The authors tested the hypothesis that these GNAS variants result in altered mortality in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, particularly in those receiving βAR blockade.', 'This prospective analysis included 1,627 European ancestry patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients were genotyped for two GNAS haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms defining three major haplotypes. Up to 5-yr all-cause mortality was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model; hazard ratios and 95% CIs were calculated while adjusting for demographics, clinical covariates, and the new EuroSCORE II.', 'Univariate analysis revealed haplotype-dependent 5-yr mortality rates (*1/*1: 18.9%, *2/*1: 13.7%, *2/*2: 9.3%, *3/*1: 10.6%, *3/*2: 9.1%, and *3/*3: 9.6%; P = 0.0006).

As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade.\\nAfter drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views.\\nMeanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \\"execute the spies\\"., what would be the answer ?","target":"Teddy","rationale":"The article says \\"As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command.\\" It also mentions that three IRA prisoners were tortured and shot.

This leaves Dan (the train driver) & Johnny Gogan - a British soldier helping with their escape - alongside Michael O'Suilleabhain and 3 other unknown men making up 6 possible candidates for this question's answer out of which only 2 possibilities exist;\\nJohnny would not fit into this possibility"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

Her father, Eduardo Cansino Sr., was from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain. Her mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish-English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917.\\nContext: When Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Eddington got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.  Haymes was born in Argentina, and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.  From the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes' ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from Confidential magazine.  After a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.  Hayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid.

Twenty-two had a small and 12 had a large aneurysm located on the internal carotid artery (17 cases), anterior communicating artery (10 cases), middle cerebral artery (five cases), and pericallosal artery (two cases). Fifty-two percent of patients with a minor leak from an internal carotid artery aneurysm had ipsilateral, hemicranial, hemifacial, or periorbital pain. Half of the patients initially saw a physician, but in no case was the correct diagnosis made. Twenty-five patients had a major rupture within 24 hours to 4 weeks after findings suggesting a minor leak, with a mortality rate of 53%. Nine other patients were diagnosed by lumbar puncture or computerized tomography (CT) scanning after initial misdiagnosis and were operated on, without mortality, before a major rupture could occur. The CT scans were negative in 55% of patients with a minor leak, but lumbar puncture, when performed, was always positive. A minor leak prior to major aneurysmal rupture is a common occurrence and, if unrecognized, is associated with a high mortality. Computerized tomography scanning is unreliable in diagnosing this event, and lumbar puncture is the examination of choice once intracranial hypertension has been ruled out. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: The minor leak preceding subarachnoid hemorrhage. option2: Ovarian histology and function after total abdominal hysterectomy.","target":"The minor leak preceding subarachnoid hemorrhage","rationale":"The title of the abstract should clearly indicate the topic of the study.

That's actually one of the claims,\\" he said. \\nQuestion: Who claimed that the Alamo Hills tenants were not looking to get rich off of their lawsuits? \\nIs the correct answer Dempsey?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The article states that the tenants were promised security and their possessions would be kept safe. However, they believe Alamo Hills did not make good on this promise because a few days later many of them lost possession to looters. The lawsuit is also asking for a small amount in addition to what they already paid so it seems like people are trying to get back money that was rightfully theirs but no more than necessary. \\nSince Dempsey claims these things about the lawsuits he must mean that \\"they're looking [to] get rich off this\\".

(nee Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. He attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nIn terms of his positions, Rohrabacher voted to repeal Obamacare, disputes evidence of man-made global warming, is a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, and favors the legalization of marijuana. In foreign policy, he supported withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, called for Trump to punish Turkish President Erdogan on embassy violence, sided with Russia in the Russia-Georgia war, gave a qualified defense of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and supports cooperating with Russia in Syria.  On May 17, 2017, the Washington Post reported that a month before Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated \\"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God.\\" Brendan Buck, counselor to Paul Ryan, initially denied these reports but later, after being informed that the Post would cite a recording as evidence, said that McCarthy had been joking.  He was warned in 2012 by the FBI that Russian spies may have been trying to recruit him to act on Russia's behalf, after he met with a member of the Russian foreign ministry privately in Moscow. Following the ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7, 2017, in which 17 innocent civilians were killed, he suggested that the attack could be viewed as 'a good thing', and surmised that President Trump might have been behind the coordination of this terrorist attack. An article in The Atlantic suggested that there was serious concern in the State Department of ties between Rohrabacher and the Russian government.  On November 21, 2017, the New York Times reported that Rohrabacher had come under scrutiny from special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee for his close ties to the Kremlin.  Rohrabacher has drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements include the conspiracy theory claims, first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website Infowars, that Democrats secretly organized the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville to provoke the violence by the alt-right (which led to the murder of one anti-Nazi protester) in order to discredit President Trump. Rochabacher has also consistently supported Russian interests in Congress and has defended Trump's controversial remarks regarding Russia.\\n\\nWhat is an important political fact people should know about his positions?","target":"He was warned in 2012 by the FBI that Russian spies may have been trying to recruit him to act on Russia's behalf,","rationale":"In the given context, we are looking for a quote which reveals an important political fact about Rohrabacher's positions.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen.
