Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.\\n\\nWhich brother didn't have excess calcium salts deposited in the blood vessels?\\n\\nHint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.","target":"Dan","rationale":"Excess calcium salts being deposited in the blood vessels is a symptom of hypercalcaemia. Since Dan was told he had normal levels, it can be inferred that Ben must have been the brother with excess deposits of calcium salts in his blood vessels.

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer.

It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.\\n\\n- Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz.

Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.\\n\\n- Palm Pictures is a US-based entertainment company owned and run by Chris Blackwell.

Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'record label'.","target":"divine operating system , palm pictures","rationale":"The rationale is \\"divine operating system , palm pictures\\"."},{"source":"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program.\\nPlanning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June.\\nPresident Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government.

In befriending Lady Bess Foster, Georgiana is crushed when Bess and The Duke begin an affair. Despite Georgiana's anger, the Duke wants Bess to remain living with them. Bess later explains to Georgiana that the reason she began the affair with the Duke was so that she could get her children back. The Duke wants a male heir, which the Duchess has not yet provided. The idea is that Bess can, since she already has three sons, of whom the Duke is very fond, treating them as if they were his own.\\nIn response to the betrayal she experiences at home, Georgiana allows herself to develop feelings for Charles Grey. However, when she asks the Duke permission to have him as a lover, the Duke is enraged and in a fit of violence, rapes Georgiana. The rape leads to a pregnancy and a son, William Cavendish, is born.

The Duke threatens not only to end Charles' political career but also to forbid Georgiana from seeing her children again if she does not end the relationship.

However, she is forced to give the child over to Charles' family, the Greys.\\nFor most of her married life, Georgiana, the Duke, and Bess live together.

Born in Kuwait to a Palestinian family, she later moved to Jordan for work, where she met the then prince Abdullah. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter.\\n\\nIn November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children. In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI).  As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. One of the stories in the book, \\"Maha of the Mountains\\", was contributed by Queen Rania. In Soweto, she was the first to write her name in the back of the Big Read, before passing it on to everyone else to write their name.  During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch \\"The Big Read\\" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.  On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the \\"1GOAL: Education for All\\" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world's biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education. On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide. Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this \\"tragedy into triumph\\" and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments.  In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, \\"End Poverty - Be the Generation,\\" which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"what did she do when she met with them?","rationale":"The best question about the article is: \\n\\"\\"what did she do when she met with them?\\"\\""},{"source":"In this task you are given a tweet.

Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker.\\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day).

Last year, I got pregnant, and while we were surprised and a bit worried, we decided to keep it. We told his mom “Sabrina” and my parents around 8 weeks in, with plans to announce to everyone else at 12 weeks. At 11 weeks, I had a miscarriage. It was extremely emotional, and happened on top of a bunch of super stressful stuff (we work at the same company and I got a promotion which meant transferring from Florida to NY, so we were temporarily long distance).  We were devastated and it didn’t help the rough patch we were in, so after a few weeks I ended up quitting my job, dumping him and moving back home to Philadelphia in a weird rom-com style “finding myself” move. During this time, Sabrina reached out to me to share a story of her own miscarriage and told me that she loved me and wanted to stay in touch, no matter what my relationship to Nick was. My mother was sympathetic of course but we aren’t really that close, and even though I was staying with her, she didn’t really know what to do with me and my mopey ass. \\nNick reached out to me two months after I left New York to let me know he was thinking of me and hoping I was doing alright - one thing led to another and I moved back in with him in our house in Florida and we’re talking about marriage. A few weeks ago, I realized I’d missed my period, took a test, and SURPRISE - five weeks along. Nick and I were overjoyed. We had a trip to Puerto Rico to visit Sabrina already planned, and while we were down there (I was 9-10 weeks along), Nick hinted that I was pregnant again at dinner with his mom, so I told her when she asked me about it after. \\nOn Valentine’s Day (13 weeks in),  Nick and I posted an announcement to social media to inform the rest of our friends and family. My mother doesn’t have social media, so I made sure to text her the announcement/photo, and also texted her that I was so grateful to her for letting me live at home with her while Nick and I were figuring stuff out. I would have called but she’s unable to get phone calls at work and I couldn’t remember what her schedule was that week. \\nShe called me a few hours later to say congratulations and then randomly asked if I’d told Sabrina yet. I was honest and said that we’d told her while we were in Puerto Rico. My mom was LIVID. She said that not only was it disrespectful to not tell her earlier than everyone on social media, but that it was doubly disrespectful to have told Sabrina before her. She accused me of playing favorites and then she said “Well, next time you and Nick have trouble being adults, you can go be a bum on Sabrina’s couch instead.” It was really hurtful, although I’m hoping she just said that out of anger. Nick doesn’t think I did anything wrong and he’s pissed at my mom (they have never liked each other). My dad says I should apologize to my mom. Nick told Sabrina about the incident (I wasn’t going to tell her about it) and she called me to tell me that my mom is an asshole.

Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.On his arrival in Japan, Rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was often referred to as an \\"English\\" photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genzō, who had been instructed to accompany the \\"Englishman\\" and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were due to a lack of the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also received photographic instruction from Rossier.

Impaired angiogenesis in fat depots has been implicated in the development of adipose tissue capillary rarefaction, hypoxia, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. We have recently demonstrated that impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis is associated with overexpression of antiangiogenic factor VEGF-A165b in human fat and the systemic circulation. In the present study, we postulated that upregulation of WNT5A is associated with angiogenic dysfunction and examined its role in regulating VEGF-A165b expression in human obesity. We biopsied subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from 38 obese individuals (body mass index: 44 ± 7 kg/m2, age: 37 ± 11 yr) during planned bariatric surgery and characterized depot-specific protein expression of VEGF-A165b and WNT5A using Western blot analysis. In both subcutaneous and visceral fat, VEGF-A165b expression correlated strongly with WNT5A protein (r = 0.9, P < 0.001). In subcutaneous adipose tissue where angiogenic capacity is greater than in the visceral depot, exogenous human recombinant WNT5A increased VEGF-A165b expression in both whole adipose tissue and isolated vascular endothelial cell fractions (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). This was associated with markedly blunted angiogenic capillary sprout formation in human fat pad explants. Moreover, recombinant WNT5A increased secretion of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a negative regulator of angiogenesis, in the sprout media (P < 0.01). Both VEGF-A165b-neutralizing antibody and secreted frizzled-related protein 5, which acts as a decoy receptor for WNT5A, significantly improved capillary sprout formation and reduced soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 production (P < 0.05). We demonstrated a significant regulatory nexus between WNT5A and antiangiogenic VEGF-A165b in the adipose tissue of obese subjects that was linked to angiogenic dysfunction. Elevated WNT5A expression in obesity may function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis.

Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat.\\nContext: In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the Junto, a group of \\"like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.\\" The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia. The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.  Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:  A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.  This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a subscription library, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, Louis Timothee.

After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

When a critical article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes, Shawn and Patrick, want revenge. Tamara attempts to perform a magical ritual to bind her fate to that of her teacher, but when she must spill her own blood she ceases the ritual. That night, a prank is orchestrated by Shawn and Patrick, along with Shawn's girlfriend Kisha. Shawn calls Tamara, impersonating Mr. Natolly, and invites her to a motel room. A video camera is placed there and catches Tamara undressing. Shawn, Patrick, and Kisha watch this, along with three others who did not know about the prank (Chloe, Jesse and Roger).

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Recent studies have reported that HCC may be derived not only from adult hepatocytes and hepatoblasts but also hepatic stem/progenitors. In this context, HepaRG cells may represent a suitable cellular model to study stem/progenitor cancer cells and the retrodifferentiation of tumor-derived hepatocyte-like cells. Indeed, they differentiate into hepatocyte- and biliary-like cells. Moreover, tumor-derived HepaRG hepatocyte-like cells (HepaRG-tdHep) differentiate into both hepatocyte- and biliary-like cells through a hepatic progenitor. In this study we report the mechanisms and molecular effectors involved in the retrodifferentiation of HepaRG-tdHep into bipotent progenitors. Gene expression profiling was used to identify genomic changes during the retrodifferentiation of HepaRG-tdHep into progenitors. We demonstrated that gene expression signatures related to a poor-prognosis HCC subclass, proliferative progenitors, or embryonic stem cells were significantly enriched in HepaRG progenitors derived from HepaRG-tdHep. HepaRG-tdHep retrodifferentiation is mediated by crosstalk between transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and inflammatory cytokine pathways (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] and interleukin 6 [IL6]). Signatures related to TNFα, IL6, and TGFβ activation pathways are induced within the first hour of retrodifferentiation.

She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots?\\n\\nHint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.","target":"plums","rationale":"Out of the fruit mentioned in the question, plums and apricots are both candied. Candying is a type of food preservation that involves dehydrating foods through sugaring or drying out their moisture content over time. This reduces microbial activity and allows for long-term storage at room temperature. The process makes fruits chewy by increasing sugar density (also known as osmotic pressure), which increases water absorption into the tissues of these fruits while drawing away free liquid molecules from them to maintain equilibrium with its surrounding environment. In addition, since there is no refrigeration involved during this procedure, it will not cause any contamination issues such as mold growth on other perishable items found inside your fridge.\\""},{"source":"Premise: A man in jeans and a blue long-sleeved shirt is on his phone while leaning on the edge of a building.\\n\\nHypothesis: A man uses a phone.\\n\\n.Choose the correct answer: Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"The premise clearly states that a man in jeans and a blue long-sleeved shirt is using his phone.

Passage:Once the S-curve is established, the committee must place the teams throughout the four regions. They were originally referred to as East, Mideast, Midwest, and West. In 1985, the Mideast designation became the Southeast, and later the South Regional in 1998. The women's tournament continued to use the Mideast terminology through 2004. In 2004, the NCAA started to identify the men's regions only by the city in which the regional semifinals and finals were played, with the same change being made for the women's tournament in 2005. The NCAA reverted to the East/South/Midwest/West designations for the men's tournament starting in 2007, but continues to designate women's regionals by their cities. Typically the cities selected will be spread throughout the country and conform roughly to the old geographic distinctions. While the regions are named for certain cities, the first and second round games are played in different cities which need not be anywhere near the regional finals. In 2005 the Austin, Texas men's regional was fed by games in Indianapolis, Indiana; Tucson, Arizona; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Worcester, Massachusetts. This is due to the \\"pod\\" system enacted before the 2002 tournament to minimize travel for as many teams as possible, especially in the early rounds. Any team may be sent to any region and any pod, although the tournament does try to keep teams, especially the top-seeded teams, closer to home. However, in 2004, Pittsburgh played its first two tournament games in Milwaukee and not in Buffalo or Columbus, cities to which it was closer. This was done to keep a lower-seeded team, the Wisconsin Badgers, close to its campus. Similarly, two east-coast teams, Maryland and Syracuse, traveled to Denver, where their opening round opponents were BYU and UTEP, both of which were geographically closer to Denver. In addition, in 2009, Kansas and West Virginia, the two higher seeds, traveled to Minneapolis to play their opponents North Dakota State and Dayton, although Dayton and North Dakota State are geographically closer to Minneapolis than Kansas and West Virginia. To make matters worse for both latter teams, Kansas City (Kansas) and Greensboro NC (West Virginia) were both 1st-2nd round sites that year.","target":"a","rationale":"The question requires information about the population of both cities and the year when the \\"pod\\" system was enacted.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.\\n\\nParagraph: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B.

The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL.

Although nearby nations like Syria also used hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his administration's use of them; in June 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home or be \\"liquidated wherever you are.\\"\\n\\nNow answer this question: In 1981, what Libyan opposition group was founded?","target":"National Front for the Salvation of Libya","rationale":"The context clearly states that the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL) was founded in 1981.\\nThis is a common type of question and provides an example of how to answer questions that asks you to extract information from the passage directly."},{"source":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)? \\n\\nContext:\\n\\nUSS \\"Chicago\\" (CA-136) was a \\"Baltimore\\"-class heavy cruiser laid down on 28 July 1943 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US, by the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

The film tells the story of extraterrestrial amoeba - like aliens that highjack a probe and , after crash landing on a small South pacific atoll , create gigantic monsters from native lifeforms ( a Kisslip cuttlefish , stone crab and Matamata turtle ) with plans of conquering the Earth . The film was released theatrically in the USA in the Summer of 1971 by American International Pictures as Yog Monster from Space .\\n\\n- Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.\\n\\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\\n\\n- , sometimes miscredited in foreign releases as \\"Inoshiro Honda\\", was a Japanese film director. He is best known for his \\"kaiju\\" and \\"tokusatsu\\" films, including several entries in the \\"Godzilla\\" series, but also worked extensively in the documentary and war genres earlier in his career. Honda was also a lifelong friend and collaborator of Akira Kurosawa, and worked with Kurosawa extensively during the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\n- Biography.\\nTsuchiya was born in Kofu, Yamanashi in 1927. His film debut was in the 1952 Shintoho film \\"Murder Suspect\\" (). During the auditions for Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Tsuchiya was watching, and was picked by Kurosawa although he originally had no intention of auditioning himself. \\n\\n- Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\\n\\n- A monster is any creature, usually found in legends or horror fiction, that is often hideous and may produce fear or physical harm by its appearance or its actions. The word \\"monster\\" derives from Latin \\"monstrum\\", meaning an aberrant occurrence, usually biological, that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order.\\n\\n- The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina.\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- Kenji Sahara (  \\"Sahara Kenji\\", born \\"Tadashi Ishihara\\") (born 14 May 1932) is a Japanese actor. He was born in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa. His real name is Masayoshi Kato (  \\"Kat Masayoshi\\"). Initially he used the name Tadashi Ishihara before changing it when he secured the lead role in \\"Rodan\\" (1956).\\n\\n- A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".\\n\\n- Related terms include , a film featuring giant monsters or a single monster and , specifically meaning the larger variety of monsters.\\n\\n- Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. \\n\\n- A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Cuttlebone, also known as cuttlefish bone, is a hard, brittle internal structure (an internal shell) found in all members of the family Sepiidae, commonly known as cuttlefish, a family within the cephalopods.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\\nAbout three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\\n\\n- Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.\\n\\n- Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films.\\n\\n- With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the \\"Lucky Dragon 5\\" incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as an antihero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity. With the end of the Cold War, several post-1984 Godzilla films shifted the character's portrayal as a symbol of nuclear weapons to that of modern Japan's forgetfulness over its imperial past, natural disasters and the overall human condition.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\\n\\n- Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.\\n\\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.\\n\\n- \\"Tokusatsu\\" entertainment often deals with science fiction, fantasy or horror, but movies and television shows in other genres can sometimes count as \\"tokusatsu\\" as well. The most popular types of \\"tokusatsu\\" include \\"kaiju\\" monster movies like the \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Gamera\\" film series; superhero TV serials such as the \\"Kamen Rider\\" and \\"Metal Hero\\"; and mecha series like \\"Giant Robo\\". Some \\"tokusatsu\\" television programs combine several of these subgenres, for example the \\"Ultraman\\" and \\"Super Sentai\\" series.\\n\\n- The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.\\n\\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'main subject' with the subject 'space amoeba'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- actor\\n - biography\\n - biology\\n - cephalopoda\\n - city\\n - consciousness\\n - design\\n - enterprise\\n - existence\\n - extraterrestrial life\\n - family\\n - fantasy\\n - film\\n - film industry\\n - filmmaking\\n - general relativity\\n - law\\n - life\\n - magic\\n - monster\\n - nature\\n - optical illusion\\n - physics\\n - reality\\n - russia\\n - science\\n - speculative fiction\\n - star\\n - sun\\n - supernatural\\n - technology\\n - time\\n - travel\\n - war\\n - world war ii","target":"cephalopoda","rationale":"The information indicates that the movie \\"Space Amoeba\\", also known as \\"Gezora,\\" was released in Japan by Toho Studios.

The range's highest point is Orevada View Benchmark, 8,506 feet (2,593 m) above sea level, in Nevada. Disaster Peak, elevation 7,781 feet (2,372 m), is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains.\\nThe mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The southern end of the range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.\\nMost of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management.  There is very little human development in the remote region—cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses—but former mines at the McDermitt Caldera produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century. Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited. Vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands. Sage grouse and mountain chickadee are two bird species native to the range, and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits.\\nDespite the area's dry climate, a few year-round streams provide habitat for the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout. Fish populations in the Trout Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land-use conflict.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions.

She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge.

He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante,  presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872).

Nicknamed The Fun Bus, Leonard was a prop forward who won 114 caps for England and five for the British and Irish Lions. His total of 119 was a world record until 2006, when it was surpassed by George Gregan. Leonard played in England teams which won four Grand Slams (1991, 1992, 1995 and 2003) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that won the test series during their 1997 tour of South Africa.\\n\\nLeonard won his first cap in a 'friendly' on 28 July 1990, against Argentina at Buenos Aires. At the age of 21 he was the youngest prop forward to ever play for England. The visitors were made to feel unwelcome, however, as the game was played on the 8th anniversary of the Falklands War. Leonard describes in his autobiography that the crowd were throwing oranges (among other things) at the England players. The most interesting object he saw on the pitch was a bathroom tap. England eventually won the game 25-12; it proved a baptism of fire for the young Leonard.  Leonard played his whole England career in a largely dominant pack and in his early career played with established forwards such as Brian Moore, Wade Dooley, Dean Richards, Mick Skinner, Mike Teague and Peter Winterbottom. The England pack of this era helped England Rugby win much success, often playing a limited 10-man game which suited the large and physical England forwards. During this period, England won back-to-back Grand Slams in 1991 and 1992. Despite losing the opening pool match to New Zealand 18-12, England made it to the Rugby World Cup Final in 1991, losing 12-6 to pre-tournament favourites Australia. In that game, England played open rugby, like they had in the Five Nations in 1990, although it was the forward-dominated 10-man game which earlier in 1991 had won them the Five Nations Grand Slam, as well as the quarter-final against France and semi-final against Scotland. The front row of Leonard, Brian Moore and Jeff Probyn was fearsome, and the England scrum was famously solid, with this trio able to more than hold their own against any front row in world.  Against Wales in 1992, Leonard suffered a neck injury: he experienced a numbing sensation in his right arm, but had no idea he had ruptured a vertibrae in his neck, so played out the remainder of the match. Later, he required emergency surgery, where bone from his hip had to be grafted into his neck. Leonard's career was in grave doubt, after only 10 tests. Due to brilliant surgery and his rehabilitation regime, however, he made a full recovery, winning his 11th cap against Canada at Twickenham that autumn without missing an England test. It is worth noting that in those days when the RFU was an amateur sporting body, Leonard was only compensated with a mere PS800.  In 1993, Leonard was selected for his first British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Jason Leonard","rationale":"The given context is clearly about the English former rugby player, Jason Leonard.

Thus, there are 5x4x3x2x1 = 120 possible numbers. However, if we focus on only those numbers with a 3 in them (since these are all we care about), then since it can't be adjacent to a 4 and since it must be adjacent to something (either on its left or right side), then we have 6 possibilities: either no number appears next to it (so that would leave 4 digits that could go anywhere else), or 1 shows up next to it but not 2 (because then it would be adjacent to a 4) - so that leaves 3 other places where any of the remaining digits could go; or 2 shows up next to it which leaves 2 other spots where any of the remaining digits could go; same with 0 and 5 until finally there is only one spot left so you're forced into using either 0 or 5 in your final digit. So you end up with: 1(4!=24) +1(3!=6)+1(2!=2)+1+1 = 34 possibilities when a 3 is in between non-adjacent non-4s\\n\\nSo if you multiply these together because each case is independent of any others then you get: 6*34 = 204 different possible integers containing at least one '3'\\n\\nBut this count also includes integers like 43xxx which has three '3's instead of just one - so we have duplicate cases here. So now let's find all integers having exactly two '3's by taking our original result from above and dividing by two ('cuz they're indistinguishable): 204/2 = 102 different cases counted twice...but we don't care about those twice counted ones. We just want those counting once - so subtract off 102 more leaving us back at our original solution: 102 - 102 = 0....and now subtract off another 24 more (=120/5!) since each integer has five \\"distinguishable\\" positions even though they were treated as identical above...and there are 24 ways given our constraints that two indistinguishable threes can be placed in each position without changing anything else..once again leaving us back at zero..so 202-102-24=0...FINALLY! Now add on this new number 24 (=120/5!) which represents how many ways both threes can appear adjacently but not adjacently touching a four....leaving us again with 204 total solutions out of 120 total possibilities satisfying both parts of our constraint..now divide by 120 again giving us 17% probability satisfying both parts but still needing them not touch each other.....which gives us 20% chance they'll satisfy both constraints..subtracting away from 100% gives 80% chance they won't satisfy either part....or 20% times 80% equals 16%.

Since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium, we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs. The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min. In 10 other dogs (group B) 0.2 mg/kg was administered. All measurements were performed during control and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after digoxin administration. In group A, digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs (1.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), whereas in group B, digoxin plasmatic level was higher (8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml).

In his 4 List A matches, he scored 42 runs at an average of 10.50, with a high score of 16. With the ball, he took 3 wickets at a bowling average of 38.33, with best figures of 2/39.\\n Passage 2:Smith was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He became a wrestling fan in the late 1950s. A childhood friend claimed that they were the first wrestling fans to bring signs to local World Wide Wrestling Federation house shows. Around 1971, Smith also co-founded an unofficial fan club for Freddie Blassie with members wearing homemade \\"Blassie's Army\\" T-shirts. As a teenager, Smith had an altercation with Kevin Sullivan while attending a live event at Sunnyside Gardens. Sullivan had been hit with an unknown object at the end of his bout against Davey O'Hannon. Smith, who often cheered for the \\"heel\\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \\"babyface\\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland. Smith denied any wrongdoing and was allowed to leave. Smith continued watching wrestling after moving to Knoxville, Tennessee in the mid-1970s. He eventually met Norvell Austin at a Southeastern Championship Wrestling.

In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American entry. When the U.S declared war, the U.S. army was still small by European standards and mobilization would take a year. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and initiated the first peacetime draft.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989).

This law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. First an action occursJerod pushes against the ground with his foot. Then a reaction occursJerod moves forward on his skateboard. The reaction is always equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction. Q: If Jerod pushes against the ground with greater force, how will this affect his forward motion? A: His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be greater as well. Jerod will be pushed forward with more force, and this will make him go faster and farther. The forces involved in actions and reactions can be represented with arrows. The way an arrow points shows the direction of the force, and the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force. Look at the skateboarders in the Figure 1.1. In the top row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders push against each other. This is the action. In the bottom row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move apart. This is the reaction. Compare the top and bottom arrows. They point in different directions, but they are the same size. This shows that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces. Because action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might think they would cancel out, as balanced forces do. But you would be wrong. Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the same object. Thats why they cancel out. Action-reaction forces are equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they dont cancel out. In fact, they often result in motion. Think about Jerod again. He applies force with his foot to the ground, whereas the ground applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward. Q: Actions and reactions occur all the time. Can you think of an example in your daily life? A: Heres one example. If you lean on something like a wall or your locker, you are applying force to it. The wall or locker applies an equal and opposite force to you.

The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community.

Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.\\n\\n- Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army. \\n\\n- The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.\\n\\n- The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area.

The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.\\n\\n- The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.\\n\\n- Shanghai (\\": Zånhae\\" ), often abbreviated as Hu or Shen, is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.\\n\\n- The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.\\n\\n- The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people.

It is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".\\n\\n- Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia.

Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception.

She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\\n\\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White and The Moonstone, as well as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her own detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer noted for his twirly large \\"magnificent moustaches\\" and egg-shaped head. Poirot had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character stemmed from real Belgian refugees who were living in Torquay and the Belgian soldiers whom she helped treat as a volunteer nurse in Torquay during the First World War.  Agatha began working on The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, writing most of it on Dartmoor. Her original manuscript was rejected by such publishing companies as Hodder and Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change the ending. She did so, and signed a contract which she later felt was exploitative. It was finally published in 1920.  Christie, meanwhile, settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, daughter Rosalind Margaret Hicks, in August 1919 at Ashfield, where the couple spent much of their time, having few friends in London. Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and started working in the City financial sector at a relatively low salary, though they still employed a maid.  Christie's second novel, The Secret Adversary (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her PS50. A third novel again featured Poirot, Murder on the Links (1923), as did short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of The Sketch magazine. In order to tour the world promoting the British Empire Exhibition, the couple left their daughter Rosalind with Agatha's mother and sister. They travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii.  They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Agatha Christie","rationale":"The paragraph is about the life of Agatha Christie.

It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.\\n\\n- Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.\\n\\n- Morgan State University (commonly referred to as MSU, Morgan State, or Morgan) is a public research university and historically black college (HBCU) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Morgan is Maryland's designated public urban university and the largest HBCU in Maryland. In 1890 the university, formerly known as the \\"Centenary Biblical Institute\\", changed its name to Morgan College to honor Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its Board of Trustees who had donated land to the college. It became a university in 1975. MSU is a member of Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\\n\\n- In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance to the flow of current in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a pn junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other semiconductors such as selenium or germanium are sometimes used.\\n\\n- Julius H. Taylor ( February 15 , 1914 - August 27 , 2011 ) was a professor emeritus from Morgan State University . He was chairperson of the department of physics . Taylor maintained a steady flow of scholarly research publications on X-Ray Diffraction , resistance of Germanium , semiconductors He presented papers at professional meetings and published widely in journals in his field , including Physics Today , The American Journal of Physics , The Physics Teacher and the American Physical Society . Taylor was a Rosenwald Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania . Taylor earned a B.S. ( 1938 ) in science from Lincoln University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Solid state physics from the University of Pennsylvania . He was the second African - American to earn the Doctorate in physics from the University of Pennsylvania . He has guided many students for their Ph.Ds in physics . During his composite forty - five years of teaching , mentoring and researching at higher educations , Taylor mentored students in the Baltimore public school system . Recently , the Lincoln University ( Pennsylvania ) honored him with Ph.D. in science for his various contributions to education .\\n\\n- Semiconductors are crystalline or amorphous solids with distinct electrical characteristics. They are of high electrical resistance   higher than typical resistance materials, but still of much lower resistance than insulators. Their resistance decreases as their temperature increases, which is behavior opposite to that of a metal. Finally, their conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by the deliberate, controlled introduction of impurities (\\"doping\\") into the crystal structure, which lowers its resistance but also permits the creation of semiconductor junctions between differently-doped regions of the extrinsic semiconductor crystal. The behavior of charge carriers which include electrons, ions and electron holes at these junctions is the basis of diodes, transistors and all modern electronics.\\n\\n- The carbon group is a periodic table group consisting of carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), and flerovium (Fl).\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\\n\\n- The Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) is an American non-profit organization that supports and represents nearly 300,000 students attending its 47 member-schools that include public historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), medical schools, and law schools. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund is named for the U.S. Supreme Court's first African-American Justice, Thurgood Marshall. \\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'julius h. taylor' and 'physicist'?","target":"occupation","rationale":"The answer is occupation."},{"source":"Choose your answer: Is \\"In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Disney's Hollywood Records, which has since remained the group's music catalogue owner in the United States and Canada.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Which Queen album was released in 1991?\\"\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The passage only mentions the label that owns Queen's music catalogue in North America.

The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan, the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, Anglesey, but the oldest parts of the present structure, which is now closed and partly in ruins, date from the 14th century.  In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second nave on the north side, separated from the earlier nave by an arcade of six arches.  Between 1839 and 1843 a new church was built nearby to serve the local community, partly due to the cost of repairing the old church. Much of the building was subsequently demolished, leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade.  The decision was condemned at the time by Harry Longueville Jones, a clergyman and antiquarian, who lamented the \\"melancholy fate\\" of what he called \\"one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey\\". Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition.\\nAfter the new church was opened, the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a time. It has been restored by the owners of the adjoining house, Plas Llanidan, and is occasionally open to the public.

Erosion is a process where natural forces such as water or wind remove soil particles, often carrying them away with other material like stones. Deposition occurs when erosion slows down so much that there isn’t enough energy left to completely remove sediment from its current location; thus it “deposits” itself on top of existing layers of rock and/or sand.

In 1980 he made his first appearance at the Piccola Scala in a production of Carlo Evasio Soliva's La testa di bronzo and performed for the first time at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino as Radamanto in Giulio Caccini's Euridice. That year also marked his debut at the Festival de Ópera de Las Palmas and the Teatro Carlo Felice, two places he has sung with some frequency. In 1982 he performed for the first time at the Teatro di San Carlo, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, the Liceu, and the Rossini Opera Festival. He sang the role of Mustafà in Gioachino Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri for his United States debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1987.

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so.\\n\\nIn August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\"  McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today.  In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions.  McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than $10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than $11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department.\\n\\nDid she have any living relatives?","target":"She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel.","rationale":"The answer is: She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel.\\nThis can be found in the article where it states \\"She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel.\\""},{"source":"(CNN)About an hour and a half before Odin Lloyd was shot to death, the suspect in his killing, Aaron Hernandez, was captured on video dancing at a gas station south of Boston.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]\\n\\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]\\n\\nand the situation: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

It is a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A belt-driven or shaft-driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low-rpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positive-displacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twin-screw and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for small-displacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range.\\n\\nAfter reading this passage, I have a question: is it possible to turbo and supercharge a car? True or False?","target":"True","rationale":"The passage states that the Twincharger is a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger.

The Long War against Habsburg Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which were never fully solved. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited, and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With the Empire's population reaching 30 million people by 1600, the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong, and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia, where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost, some permanently. This 1603–1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha, which ceded the entire Caucasus, except westernmost Georgia, back into Iranian Safavid possession.

It’s important to note that withdrawal is a normal, natural, healthy part of recovery. People who go through it might feel ill and uncomfortable, but those feelings do pass. Frequently Asked Questions - Xanax Drug Test / Valium Drug Test Q: What are benzodiazepines? A: Benzodiazepines are a very large family of prescription drugs that include Valium, Xanax, Librium, Ativan, Halcion, Diazepam, and Klonopin. 1 Valium is a federal controlled substance (C-IV) because it can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep Valium in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. 2  It is not known if Valium is safe and effective in children under 6 months of age. 3  It is not known if Valium is safe and effective for use longer than 4 months. Common Valium side effects may include: 1  drowsiness; 2  tired feeling; 3  muscle weakness; or. 4  loss of coordination. Valium belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which work by increasing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that moderates the activity of nerve signals in the brain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved diazepam in 1963 under the brand name Valium for the Roche drug company. If you have any questions on how to use Valium for opiate withdrawal symptoms, feel free to post them in the comment box below. Most results conclude smoking tobacco does in fact hinder the effects of Diazepam (I have read the science behind why, but it doesn't seem relevant to my interest). I do not smoke cigarettes, never have, and never will. I do vape quite often so this is a very important subject to me as I do take Valium. It's been a struggle finding the exact answer the to titled question (for me). I sincerely apologize if I have overlooked a post which exactly answers this concern. TL;DR - Does vaping nicotine decrease the effects of Diazepam's anxiety relief. Does Zoloft (sertraline) have a similar effect on the body as valium, but Zoloft (sertraline) takes longer to work?

The radiant luminous efficacy (LER) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power radiated over all wavelengths. The source luminous efficacy (LES) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp. Visible light is measured in lumens, a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous efficacy of radiant energy (LER) is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye. The units of luminous efficacy are \\"lumens per watt\\" (lpw).

It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4. The \\"four-minute barrier\\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.

The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any time one surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching, and friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your hands together and you’ll feel the heat generated by the friction between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the tires and road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them.\\n\\nParagraph: There was a carnival game at the fair that allowed you to win a basketball if you could correctly guess which of the two balls had spun around a circular track more times.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.","target":"Thomas","rationale":"The answer is \\"Thomas\\", because water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.

Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.\\nIn late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the first name of the person whose design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod?","target":"Edward","rationale":"As the context mentions, Edward Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.\\nSo the answer is Edward."},{"source":"DIALOG:\\nWhat year was Lawrence Alma-Tadema's move to England?\\n- Alma-Tadema arrived in London in December 1869.\\n- Why did Lawrence Alma-Tadema move to England?\\n- The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870 compelled Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London.\\n- What did Lawrence Alma-Tadema do when arriving to England?\\n- After his arrival in London, Alma-Tadema met Laura Theresa Epps, who was seventeen years old, and fell in love with her at first sight.\\n- Who was Laura Theresa Epps to Lawrence Alma-Tadema?\\n- His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England.\\n- Did Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Laura Theresa Epps have a relationship?\\n- They married in July 1871.\\n- Did Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Laura Theresa Epps have any kids?\\n-","target":"This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence.","rationale":"\\"\\nThe given dialog contains the question: \\"Did Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Laura Theresa Epps have any kids?\\" The answers are: (A) This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence.

These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine.

Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system.\\n\\n- Roger Keith Coleman ( November 1 , 1958 -- May 20 , 1992 ) was a Grundy , Virginia , coal miner convicted and executed for the murder of his sister - in - law , Wanda McCoy . Coleman 's case drew national and worldwide attention before and after his execution because of his repeated claims of innocence and support from the anti death - penalty movement . In 2006 , Virginia Governor Mark Warner announced that recently re-examined DNA evidence had conclusively proven Coleman 's guilt .\\n\\n- Manslaughter is a legal term for homicide considered by law as less culpable than murder. The distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said to have first been made by the Ancient Athenian lawmaker Draco in the 7th century BCE.\\n\\n- Malice aforethought was the \\"premeditation\\" or \\"predetermination\\" (with malice) that was required as an element of some crimes in some jurisdictions and a unique element for first-degree or aggravated murder in a few. Insofar as the term is still in use, it has a technical meaning that has changed substantially over time.\\n\\n- Grundy is a town in Buchanan County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,105 at the 2000 census and 1,021 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Buchanan County. The town is noted for its educational institutions and their role in the town's economic rebirth. The town served as a stopover for Union troops on their way to the Battle of Saltville. The town is also noteworthy for its flood control project, where the mountain across the river was blasted to make way for new development.\\n\\n- Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'manner of death' with the subject 'roger keith coleman'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- battle\\n - capital punishment\\n - homicide\\n - killing\\n - murder\\n - war","target":"capital punishment","rationale":"The entity 'roger keith coleman' has the relation of \\"is a type\\" with the object entity homicide, so we know he is involved in a killing. \\nCapital punishment and murder are both types of homicides that could have been used to kill roger keith coleman (i.e., capital punishment would be an appropriate way for someone to die who was convicted of murder).

He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968, effectively as a replacement for founder member Syd Barrett, who was dismissed from the band shortly afterwards. Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; it was estimated that by 2012 the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States.\\nContext: Gilmour was responsible for bringing Kate Bush to public attention. While she was still at school, her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. Gilmour received a copy of the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell (who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums) and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. Gilmour then arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.  Gilmour is credited as executive producer on two tracks on her debut album The Kick Inside, including her second single \\"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\\". He performs backing vocals on \\"Pull Out the Pin\\", on her fourth album, The Dreaming, and plays guitar on \\"Love and Anger\\" and \\"Rocket's Tail\\" on her sixth, The Sensual World.  In March 1987, Bush, notorious for the rarity of her live performances, sang \\"Running Up That Hill\\" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball with Gilmour on guitar. A three DVD set of The Secret Policeman's Balls benefit concerts that includes their performance was released in 2009.

HARRINGTON??  At the first attempt Eleanor does not fall pregnant, but subsequent efforts yield success. However by then Roger is obsessed by Eleanor, believing he is madly in love, even though she makes it clear it is only a business arrangement and that she loves her husband. Arthur bans Roger from seeing Eleanor again, but Roger then threatens to expose the scheme, bringing disgrace to the family. Arthur then phones his lawyer to tell him of the problems Roger is causing.\\nA young priest, Father Michael McKinnon, arrives in the parish and is introduced by the Senior priest to the Barretts as \\"his favourite family in the whole world\\" as they make large donations to the church.

By nature he meant matter animated by \\"the Divine breath\\"; i.e., he was an animist. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from \\"the animals nearest to him\\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. The history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \\"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\\".","target":"nature","rationale":"The context mentions the scientist Waitz.

Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed.

An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end.\\nMeanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others. \\nWhen they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days. That night, John finds the wandering horse bearing Gray's body and takes him home.\\nWesley lies to his father that Gray will meet them in the next town. Gray's horse wanders into town, where John and Nora remove the wounded man from the saddle and take him into their home.

As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.\\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015.\\nThere is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.\\nIn 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally.

The film 's title is a reference to the leet version of the Dutch phrase \`\` ( ik ) ben niks '' , meaning \`\` ( I ) am nothing '' . The novel was inspired by the true story of a boy with autism who committed suicide because of bullying . The film won three awards at the 31st Montreal World Film Festival : the Grand Prix des Amériques , the Prix du Public for the most popular film , and the Ecumenical Jury Prize for its exploration of ethical and social values .

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

It uses some characters to replace others in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance.

The word derives from the Greek , meaning \\"concurrence\\". In some instances a syndrome is so closely correlated with a pathogenesis or etiology that the words \\"syndrome\\", \\"disease\\", and \\"disorder\\" end up being used interchangeably for them. This is especially true of inherited syndromes. For example, Down syndrome, WolfHirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the \\"syndrome\\" nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.\\n\\n- An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language.

The 1946 Broadway production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both New York (1,147 performances) and London, spawning revivals, a 1950 film version and television versions. Songs that became hits include \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\", \\"Doin' What Comes Natur'lly\\", \\"You Can't Get a Man with a Gun\\",\\n\\nIn 1999, a new production had its pre-Broadway engagement at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., from December 29, 1998 to January 24, 1999. Previews began on Broadway on February 2, 1999 at the Marquis Theatre, with an official opening on March 4, 1999, and closed on September 1, 2001 after 35 previews and 1,045 performances.  This revival starred Bernadette Peters as Annie and Tom Wopat as Frank, and Ron Holgate as Buffalo Bill, with direction by Graciela Daniele, choreographey by Jeff Calhoun, and music arrangements by John McDaniel. Peters won the 1999 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the production won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.  This production had a revised book by Peter Stone and new orchestrations, and was structured as a \\"show-within-a-show\\", set as a Big Top travelling circus. \\"Frank Butler\\" is alone on stage and Buffalo Bill introduces the main characters, singing \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\", which is reprised when \\"Annie\\" agrees to join the traveling Wild West show. The production dropped several songs (including \\"Colonel Buffalo Bill\\", \\"I'm A Bad, Bad Man\\", and \\"I'm an Indian Too\\"), but included \\"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\\". There were several major dance numbers added, including a ballroom scene. A sub-plot which had been dropped from the 1966 revival, the romance between Winnie and Tommy, her part-Native-American boyfriend, was also included.

We both thought this would be fine, as we left the \\"reserved\\" seats empty. 20 minutes later, a couple comes by. I was reading, Rob was sleeping. I heard them talk (not English) so I looked up at them and then they asked me why we took their seats. I haaaate confrontation as I have pretty bad social anxiety. I politely told them that my friend and I were looking for seats and we took the 2 that were empty. They are welcome to return to the 2 seats they reserved.

He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by Michael Jackson, including Thriller, the best-selling album of all time. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013.\\nIn 1976, when Lukather was nineteen years old, he was invited by his high school friends David Paich and the Porcaro brothers Steve and Jeff to join them in forming their band, Toto.

The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches.

These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the FranceHabsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. In the 17th century, religious beliefs and practices were a much larger influence on an average European than they are today.

The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time travelling. \\nTechnically, a \\"monastery\\" or \\"nunnery\\" is a community of monastics, whereas a \\"friary\\" or \\"convent\\" is a community of mendicants, and a \\"canonry\\" a community of canons regular. The terms \\"abbey\\" and \\"priory\\" can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an Abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a Prior.\\n\\n- The Dissolution of the Monasteries, sometimes referred to as the Suppression of the Monasteries, was the set of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541 by which Henry VIII disbanded Catholic monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and reassigned or dismissed their former members and functions. Although the policy was originally envisaged as increasing the regular income of the Crown, much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry's military campaigns in the 1540s. He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him \\"Supreme Head\\" of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority, and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539).

They advance Luther's positions against what he saw as abusive practices by preachers selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers themselves or their loved ones in purgatory. In the \\"Theses\\", Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than the system of sacramental confession of the Catholic Church. He argued that indulgences lead Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they can forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discourage Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the pope, the \\"Theses\\" challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The \\"Theses\\" are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the \\"Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences\\".\\n\\n- Huldrych Zwingli or Ulrich Zwingli (1 January 1484  11 October 1531) was a leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. Born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the Swiss mercenary system, he attended the University of Vienna and the University of Basel, a scholarly center of Renaissance humanism.

The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.\\n\\n- The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \\"Apostle to the English\\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams.\\n\\n- John Calvin (; born : 10 July 150927 May 1564) was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism, aspects of which include the doctrines of predestination and of the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation, in which doctrines Calvin was influenced by and elaborated upon the Augustinian and other early Christian traditions. Various Congregational, Reformed, and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\\n\\n- The Province of York is one of two ecclesiastical provinces making up the Church of England and consists of 12 dioceses which cover the northern third of England and the Isle of Man. York was elevated to an archbishopric in  735: Ecgbert was the first archbishop. At one time the Archbishops of York also claimed metropolitan authority over Scotland but these claims were never realised and ceased when the Archdiocese of St Andrews was established.\\n\\n- Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior bishop in the Church of England.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: When did design thinking begin to be a thing?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. in the early 60's\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC.

Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States.

Here, we investigated the co-expression patterns in gene expression data and proposed a correlation-based research method to stratify individuals. Using blood from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we investigated the gene expression profiles from whole blood using Affymetrix microarray technology. Co-expressed genes were analyzed by a biclustering method, followed by gene ontology analysis of the relevant biclusters. Taking the type I interferon (IFN) pathway as an example, a classification algorithm was developed from the 102 RA patients and extended to 10 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 100 healthy volunteers to further characterize individuals. We developed a correlation-based algorithm referred to as Classification Algorithm Based on a Biological Signature (CABS), an alternative to other approaches focused specifically on the expression levels. This algorithm applied to the expression of 35 IFN-related genes showed that the IFN signature presented a heterogeneous expression between RA, SLE and healthy controls which could reflect the level of global IFN signature activation. Moreover, the monitoring of the IFN-related genes during the anti-TNF treatment identified changes in type I IFN gene activity induced in RA patients. In conclusion, we have proposed an original method to analyze genes sharing an expression pattern and a biological function showing that the activation levels of a biological signature could be characterized by its overall state of correlation. \\n Question: Which is the most common gene signature in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients?","target":"ifn signature","rationale":"The answer is \\"ifn signature\\" which is a phrase from the passage."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question and an answer, you would be asked to create the sentence based on the Question-Answer provided.

A similar LPC has been reported in cats and monkeys. In this study, the LPC of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in the cat was used to detect impairment in attention to a relevant stimulus after low levels of cerebral concussion produced by a fluid percussion device. A hollow screw (for fluid percussion) and stainless steel screws (for AEP recording) were surgically placed in the skull. After recovery from surgery, animals were trained in the paradigm to obtain an LPC. Pupillary dilation was conditioned to tones. A random sequence of two discriminable tones was presented. The lower tone had a probability of 0.1 and was followed by a tail shock (tone-shock). After 400 to 1000 tone-shock presentations, animals attended to the lower tone stimulus as inferred by selective pupillary dilation. In the AEP an early positive component at 50 to 120 msec related to an alerting response was enhanced, and an LPC at 250 to 450 msec appeared in response to the paired tone-shock. Animals were then subjected to cerebral concussion. Complete recovery of normal reflexes, motor coordination, and orienting response was seen within 2 hours after injury. The LPC was suppressed for a period of at least 3 days, suggesting that low magnitudes of brain injury can disrupt higher-order neural activities. This disruption can persist despite recovery of other neurological functions. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Transient suppression of event-related evoked potentials produced by mild head injury in the cat. option2: Detection of preterm labor by ambulatory monitoring of uterine activity: a preliminary report.","target":"Transient suppression of event-related evoked potentials produced by mild head injury in the cat","rationale":"The abstract clearly describes a study in which the authors investigated whether cerebral concussion can disrupt higher-order neural activities by measuring late positive components of auditory evoked potentials.

Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.","target":"Botany","rationale":"The key point that the passage emphasizes is the evolution of land plants, especially their specialized polysaccharide molecules and biochemical strategies.\\nSo, based on this description, we can conclude that Botany (the study of plant life) would be a suitable topic for this paragraph"},{"source":"Write the conversation response.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America.

Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86).  Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.  Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22).\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Emiliano Zapata","rationale":"The context is a description of the life and actions of Emiliano Zapata, one of Mexico's leading figures in its revolution.

However, in recent years, more and more American students are preparing for college by taking a gap year. The advantages of taking a gap year are as follows:\\nLearn about the World and Yourself\\nAlthough you don't have to go abroad to experience gap years, most gap year students catch the chance to travel abroad. You are able to work out who you are and what you are for. The experiences of different cultures offer you interesting lessons. You can learn more about the world and get to know yourself better.\\nFace Challenges and Have Fun\\nA gap year is not only a time to take a vacation, but also a time to face challenges. Gap year students usually work, volunteer or take service projects. You have to learn how to get along in the real world. This process isn't always easy, but it is an important part of growing up. Only in this way can you enjoy life and have fun.\\nSave Money and Improve Your College Admission Chances\\nThere's a common thought that gap years are only for rich students,but it' s not true. Actually, taking a gap year can save your money. Gap year students often take a part-time job. Besides, at the end of a gap year, students are much more likely to know what to study in college.

However, a known weakness is a failure to perform well when evaluated on data which differ from the training distribution, even if these differences are very small, as is the case with adversarial examples.   We propose \\\\emph{Fortified Networks}, a simple transformation of existing networks, which “fortifies” the hidden layers in a deep network by identifying when the hidden states are off of the data manifold, and maps these hidden states back to parts of the data manifold where the network performs well. Our principal contribution is to show that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models; (ii) suggest that our improvements are not primarily due to the problem of deceptively good results due to degraded quality in the gradient signal (the gradient masking problem) and (iii) show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of the input space.   We demonstrate improvements in adversarial robustness on three datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10), across several attack parameters, both white-box and black-box settings, and the most widely studied attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner).
