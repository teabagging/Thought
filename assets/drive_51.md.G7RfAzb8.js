The park, nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, is in the Loyalsock Creek valley on Pennsylvania Route 154, in Forks and Shrewsbury Townships southeast of the borough of Forksville. The name Worlds End has been used since at least 1872, but its origins are uncertain. Although it was founded as Worlds End State Forest Park by Governor Gifford Pinchot in 1932, the park was officially known as Whirls End State Forest Park from 1936 to 1943.The park's land was once home to Native Americans, followed by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially a result of the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\\nA wide variety of wildlife is found in the park, which is also part of an Important Bird Area.

The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny. In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with \\"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\\". Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list. In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.

It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. The current line-up--guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell--performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002. They resumed touring from December 31, 2002, until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show.\\n\\nPhish was formed at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists Trey Anastasio and Jeff Holdsworth, bassist Mike Gordon, and drummer Jon Fishman. For their first gig, at Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983, the band was billed as \\"Blackwood Convention\\". (\\"Blackwood convention\\" is a term from the card game contract bridge.) The band was joined by percussionist Marc Daubert in the fall of 1984, a time during which they promoted themselves as playing Grateful Dead songs. Daubert left the band early in 1985, and Page McConnell then joined the group on keyboards and made his debut on May 3, 1985, at a show at Wilks/Davis/Wing Dormitory on Redstone Campus at UVM. Holdsworth left the group after graduating in 1986, solidifying the band's lineup of \\"Trey, Page, Mike, and Fish\\"--the lineup to this day.  Following a prank at UVM with his friend and former bandmate Steve Pollak--also known as \\"The Dude of Life\\"--Anastasio decided to leave the college. With the encouragement of McConnell (who received $50 for each transferee), Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College, a small school in the hills of Plainfield, Vermont. Phish distributed at least six different experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including The White Tape. This first studio recording was circulated in two variations: the first, mixed in a dorm room as late as 1985, received a higher distribution than the second studio remix of the original four tracks, c. 1987. The older version was officially released under the title Phish in August 1998.  Jesse Jarnow's book Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America details much of the band's early years at Goddard College, including their early relationship with fellow Goddard students Richard \\"Nancy\\" Wright and Jim Pollock. Pollock and Wright were musical collaborators, experimenting with multi-track cassette records to be broadcast on local radio. Phish adopted a number of Nancy's songs into their own set, including \\"Halley's Comet\\", \\"I Didn't Know\\", and \\"Dear Mrs. Reagan\\", the latter song being written by Nancy and Pollock. Jarnow argues that despite an eventual falling out between the members of Phish and Nancy, Nancy and his music were highly influential to Phish's early style and experimental sound. Pollock continued to collaborate with Phish over the years, designing some of their most iconic concert posters.  The band's actions demonstrate an identity with their \\"hometown\\" of Burlington, Vermont. By 1985, the group had encountered Burlington luthier Paul Languedoc, who would eventually design four guitars for Anastasio and two basses for Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc has built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity. Also during the late 1980s, Phish played regularly at Nectar's restaurant and bar in Burlington. In 1992 the album A Picture of Nectar, named as a tribute to the owner, featured a large orange with Nectar's photo superimposed subtly within the orange.  By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special \\"secret language\\", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio \\"teased\\" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, \\"D'oh!\\" in imitation of  Homer Simpson . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the \\"Big Ball Jam\\" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.  In an experiment known as \\"The Rotation Jam\\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, a performance of \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers, jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments.  Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year. The following year A Picture of Nectar was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's Junta or 1990's Lawn Boy. These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well.  The first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters. The lineup, among others, included Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. That summer, the band toured Europe with the Violent Femmes and later toured Europe and the U.S. with Carlos Santana.  Phish began headlining major amphitheaters in the summer of 1993. That year, the group released Rift packaged as a concept album and with heavy promotion from Elektra including artwork by David Welker. In 1994, the band released Hoist. To promote the album, the band made their only video for MTV, \\"Down with Disease\\", airing in June of that year. Foreshadowing their future tradition of festivals, Phish coupled camping with their summer tour finale at Sugarbush North in Warren, Vermont, in July 1994, that show eventually being released as Live Phish Volume 2. On Halloween of that year, the group promised to don a fan-selected \\"musical costume\\" by playing an entire album from another band. After an extensive mail-based poll, Phish performed the Beatles' White Album as the second of their three sets at the Glens Falls Civic Center in upstate New York. For their 1994 New Years Run, Phish played the Civic Centers in Philadelphia and Providence as well as sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden, which were their debuts at each venue. Following the death of Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia in the summer of 1995 and the appearance of \\"Down with Disease\\" on Beavis and Butt-Head, the band experienced a surge in the growth of their fan base and an increased awareness in popular culture.  In their tradition of playing a well-known album by another band for Halloween, Phish contracted a full horn section for their performance of The Who's Quadrophenia in 1995. Their first live album--A Live One--which was released during the summer of 1995, became Phish's first RIAA-certified gold album in November 1995.  Phish retreated to their Vermont recording studio and recorded hours and hours of improvisations, sometimes overlaying them on one another, and included some of the result on the second half of Billy Breathes, which they released in the fall of 1996. Alongside traditional rock-based crescendos, the album has more acoustic guitar than their previous records, and was regarded by the band and some fans as their crowning studio achievement. The album's first single, \\"Free\\", peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, becoming the band's most successful chart single of their career.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Phish","rationale":"The given text is an article on Phish, a rock band.

Tibia fractures were divided into three groups: Group I, nonoperative treatment; Group II, early open reduction and internal fixation; and Group III, Type III open injuries. Group I included 17 fractures, of which nine (53%) had delayed union, malunion, or nonunion. The average time to union was 6.5 months. Seven patients had pressure sores and pulmonary emboli. Eleven fractures were noted in Group II. One delayed union (9%), one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully, and one deep vein thrombosis were noted. The average time to union was 12 weeks. All six Group III tibias had delayed and nonunions, regardless of treatment. Nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate, while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union.

ORIF also resulted in fewer orthopedic and medical complications overall. As a result, it was recommended as a preferred alternative to nonoperative treatment for improving medical outcomes.\\" This is reflected by Option 1 (\\\\\\"The management of tibial fractures in acute spinal cord injury patients\\\\\\"), but not by Option 2 (\\\\\\"Principles behind therapeutic embryo freezing\\\\\\").

When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house.

The Long War against Habsburg Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which were never fully solved. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited, and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With the Empire's population reaching 30 million people by 1600, the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong, and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia, where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost, some permanently. This 1603–1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha, which ceded the entire Caucasus, except westernmost Georgia, back into Iranian Safavid possession.

Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which fruit had a higher sugar content, mangoes or raspberries?","target":"mangoes","rationale":"Raspberries have a higher sugar content than mangoes."},{"source":"I have a new situation: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which test would need lower temperature, case A or case B ?","target":"case B","rationale":"The background information explains that it takes higher temperatures for polar compounds to undergo changes of state.

We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. There’s a train that goes into town but most days fiancé’s parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so they’ll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \\n\\nAll has been generally fine, my fiancé’s parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30’s especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fiancé’s parents back and forth from the vacation home, I’ve suggested to my fiancé that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\\n\\nThe other day as my fiancé and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fiancé that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didn’t like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know we’re ok staying on the train. But despite my fiancé’s efforts to tell them that we’re fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fiancé at one point) so my fiancé gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fiancé tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\\n\\nThen the next day, my fiancé had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousin’s place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fiancé messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousin’s to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousin’s as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \\n\\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fiancé’s parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fiancé’s time when we’re on vacation? I understand that some parents will always see their kids as children no matter how old they are, but I felt especially annoyed when I was forced to cut short my time with my cousin who I only see once a year because it was apparently “bedtime.” On the other hand, I am so thankful to have in-laws who accept me as one of their own, as I’ve had ex-girlfriends whose parents didn’t like me for whatever reason and I’m thankful to be not dealing with trying to win approval. \\n\\nTL;DR: On holiday in my fiancé’s hometown. Fiancé’s parents are overly accommodating and can come off as controlling. On the other hand, fiancé’s parents are genuinely the nicest most generous people you’ll ever meet so I feel bad for coming off as being ungrateful for their hospitality.","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post is upset with the parents for wanting to drive them home from their cousin's house.

He grew up in the South and was steeped in its history. His birthplace was less than a hundred miles from the site of Nat Turner's slave rebellion, later the source for Styron's most famous and controversial novel.  Although Styron's paternal grandparents had been slave owners, his Northern mother and liberal Southern father gave him a broad perspective on race relations. Styron's childhood was a difficult one. His father, a shipyard engineer, suffered from clinical depression, which Styron himself would later experience. His mother died from breast cancer in 1939 when Styron was still a boy, following her decade-long battle with the disease.  Styron attended public school in Warwick County, first at Hilton School and then at Morrison High School (now known as Warwick High School) for two years, until his father sent him to Christchurch School, an Episcopal college-preparatory school in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Styron once said, \\"But of all the schools I attended...only Christchurch ever commanded something more than mere respect--which is to say, my true and abiding affection.\\"  Upon graduation, Styron enrolled in Davidson College and joined Phi Delta Theta. By the age of eighteen he was reading the writers who would have a lasting influence on his vocation as a novelist and writer, especially Thomas Wolfe. Styron transferred to Duke University in 1943 as a part of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps V-12 program aimed at fast-tracking officer candidates by enrolling them simultaneously in basic training and bachelor's degree programs.

Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners.\\nA year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage.

These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 –  the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system.

František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.\\nThe Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.

This means that all vehicles such as cars, trains, buses, planes and ships that need oil to work will not be able to run. So it will be necessary to develop a new system of transport which uses a fuel more than oil. Electric vehicles are one possibility. In Britain, most families have at least one car and this car is used every day. It could be that only one person in the family drives the car to work or for shopping. The number of cars on the road which are almost empty perhaps helps to explain why the oil is used up so quickly. The family car is a very useful form of transport but it is also a great waste of energy, especially if it is compared with buses or trains. Much petrol is used by a car which is traveling at 120 kilometers an hour. Clearly, it would be better if there were fewer cars on the road and more speed limits so that the oil which is left will last as long as possible.\\nAbout 25% of Britain's total consumption of energy is _ --it is used only in the home. Just over 20% is used for transport. Most of the energy is used in industry. It is difficult to suggest any possible energy conservation in industry because many of the suggestions would mean that some people would lose their jobs. It is important that industry produces the same amount of products using the same amount of workers.\\nObviously, conservation is not going to be the answer to the energy crisis . The most it can do is to give more time for a better solution to be found.

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.","target":"Common Nodes of Virus-Host Interaction Revealed Through an Integrated Network Analysis","rationale":"The abstract describes the results of a meta-analysis that was designed to elucidate the host-virus interactomes to advance our understanding of virus-host interactions.

During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth.\\n\\n- Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan ( Spanish : Apolo en la Fragua de Vulcano ) is an oil painting by Diego de Velázquez completed after his first visit to Italy in 1629 . Critics agree that the work should be dated to 1630 , the same year as his companion painting \`\` Joseph 's Tunic '' . It appears that neither of the two paintings were commissioned by the king , although both became part of the royal collections within a short time . The painting became part of the collection of the Museo del Prado , in Madrid , in 1819 .\\n\\n- Hieronymus Bosch (born Jheronimus van Aken ; 1450  9 August 1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter from Brabant. He is widely considered one of the most notable representatives of Early Netherlandish painting school. His work is known for its fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes, and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell.\\n\\n- Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \\"Apolln\\"; Doric: , \\"Apelln\\"; Arcadocypriot: , \\"Apeiln\\"; Aeolic: , \\"Aploun\\") is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the \\"kouros\\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \\"Apulu\\".\\n\\n- The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection.\\n\\n- Sir Peter Paul Rubens (28 June 1577  30 May 1640) was a Flemish/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter. He is widely considered as the most notable artist of Flemish Baroque art school. A proponent of an extravagant Baroque style that emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, Rubens is well known for his Counter-Reformation altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects.\\n\\n- Doménikos Theotokópoulos (; 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco, was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" (\\"The Greek\\") was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters,   (\\"Doménikos Theotokópoulos\\"), often adding the word  (\\"Krs\\", \\"Cretan\\").\\n\\n- Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus.

He is currently the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\\n\\nFollowing the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare after the 1985-86 season, then-Head Coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman captain of the team on October 7, 1986, making him the youngest captain in the team's history. Demers said he \\"wanted a guy with the Red Wings crest tattooed on his chest.\\" The next season, Yzerman led the Wings to their first division title in 23 years.  During the 1988-89 season, Yzerman recorded 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists), finishing third in regular season scoring behind Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky and also winning the Lester B. Pearson Award (MVP as voted by the National Hockey League Players' Association), and was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP as voted by the NHL writers).  When Scotty Bowman took over as coach in 1993, Yzerman initially chafed under Bowman's stern coaching style. Bowman, for his part, felt that Yzerman was not concentrating enough on defence; Bowman had long expected his forwards to be good back-checkers as well. Relations between the two became so strained that at one point, the Red Wings seriously considered trading him to the then-moribund Ottawa Senators. Yzerman, however, gradually became a better defender and is now considered one of the best two-way forwards in the history of the game.  In 1995, Yzerman led Detroit to its first Stanley Cup finals series since 1966, but the Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils. Before the start of the 1995-96 NHL season, Yzerman's leadership was called into question and soon he had to deal with rumours that he was to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Mathieu Schneider and a first-round draft pick, a deal that was publicized in Le Journal de Montreal as being pushed for hard by Yzerman's former coach Jacques Demers. Detroit finished the season with an NHL-record 62 regular season wins and were heavily favoured to win the Stanley Cup. Yzerman scored perhaps the most memorable goal of his career in the 1996 playoffs, stealing the puck from Wayne Gretzky and beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Jon Casey with a slap shot from the blue line to win the Western Conference Semifinals in double overtime of Game 7. The Red Wings, however, fell short of their ultimate goal, losing in six games to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals.

These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure, raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety.   \\n OBJECTIVE To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults.   \\n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective, population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites (OptumInsight Epidemiology, Tennessee Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and the HMO Research Network), starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites, with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data. Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine at baseline. Each medication user (n = 150,359) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site, birth year, sex, and calendar year (443,198 total users and nonusers).   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or stroke, with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias.   \\n RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.3 years per person), 1357 cases of MI, 296 cases of SCD, and 575 cases of stroke occurred. There were 107,322 person-years of current use (median, 0.33 years), with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.14-1.57) for MI, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.20-0.42) for SCD, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.43-0.72) for stroke. The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.96). Among new users of ADHD medications, the adjusted RR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.94). The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.86-1.24); for new use vs remote use, the adjusted RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.82-1.28); the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25-44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45-64 years.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias.","target":"ADHD medications and risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults","rationale":"This paper examines whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults.

She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a male gaze), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in \\"The Crying Face\\", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \\"pictorial formula for crying\\".\\nBy the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes. Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in Sainte-Baume and is often shown with a book, reading or... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the Magdalen who became associated with weeping and reading?, what is it ?","target":"Mary","rationale":"Mary is the first name of the Magdalen who became associated with weeping and reading."},{"source":"Svetlana Aleksandrovna Metkina (Russian: Светлана Александровна Меткина ; born 7 January 1974) is a Russian actress from Moscow.

When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants.

Ethnic Mon officials selected Smim Htaw Buddhaketi, a cousin of the king at Ava, as their king. The court at Pegu consolidated its hold in Lower Burma. Starting in 1742, Pegu, with renegade Dutch and Portuguese musketeers, began its annual raids of the upcountry. Because of the Manipuri threat, Ava could only send small armies to the south in 1743 and 1744, neither of which made any mark. The war \\"carried on languidly\\", with neither side achieving any lasting advantage until 1747.

He was not satisfied to gain independence for Lower Burma itself but determined to make Upper Burma its tributary. He stopped the annual raids and began planning for a decisive invasion. He sought and received French East India Company's support in firearms. Alarmed, Ava too sought support from China but no help materialised. In November 1751, Pegu launched a full-scale invasion by land and by river with a total strength of 30,000. Ava had prepared an extensive defensive line around Ava—a riverside fort at Sinbyukyun on the Irrawaddy, and a series of forts at Sintgaing, Tada-U and Pinya en route to Ava.

Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- Erwin Schell was a Dean of the MIT Department of Business and Engineering from 1930 through 1951 .

Passage:American singer and songwriter Mary J. Blige began her career as a backing vocalist for Uptown Records in the early 1990s. She has released 13 studio albums, eight of which have individually achieved worldwide multi-platinum status. The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul and Queen of R&B (publications often refer to her as both honorific titles), Mary J. Blige is uniquely credited as the first singer to release an album singing over hip-hop beats, which created the genre \\"hip hop soul\\" which fuses elements of soul, R&B and gospel style vocals over hip hop beats. Blige's genre-changing sound, in many ways, changed and shaped the sound for modern day R&B and blue-eyed soul artists. In September 1999, Rolling Stone bestowed her first album, What's the 411? (1992), as \\"genre-creating\\". Her discography consists of 14 top 10 Billboard 200 studio albums, two live albums, two remix albums and over eighty singles—including more than 20 as a featured artist. In 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Blige as the most successful female R&B/hip-hop artist of the past 25 years. In March 2017, Billboard magazine ranked her 2006 song \\"Be Without You\\" as the most successful R&B/hip-hop song of all time, as it spent an unparalleled 75 weeks on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 15 of those weeks at number one.

Penson won 50 games pitching for his base team, although sources disagree about the branch in which he served, reported as the United States Air Force and the U.S. Army. Penson made the Phillies out of training camp in 1954 as a member of the team's early-season, 28-man roster. His five games pitched included three starts, and he split two decisions. His lone MLB win came in his first start, on Sunday, May 16, 1954. in the second game of a doubleheader at Connie Mack Stadium. He went six innings against the St. Louis Cardinals, and allowed four hits, four bases on balls, and one earned run. But he was forced to leave the game leading 6–3 when the game was suspended because of Pennsylvania blue laws prohibiting sporting events on Sunday evenings.

Thrillers heavily stimulate the viewer's moods, giving them a high level of anticipation, ultra-heightened expectation, uncertainty, surprise, anxiety and terror. Films of this genre tend to be adrenaline-rushing, gritty, rousing and fast-paced. A thriller provides the sudden rush of excitement, and exhilaration that drive the narrative, sometimes subtly with peaks and lulls, sometimes at a constant, breakneck pace. It keeps the audience on the \\"edge of their seats\\", akin to the sensation of hanging from a cliff, as the plot builds towards a climax. Literary devices such as red herrings, plot twists, and cliffhangers are used extensively. A thriller is usually a villain-driven plot, whereby he or she presents obstacles that the protagonist must overcome. Common subgenres are psychological thrillers, crime thrillers, erotic thrillers and mystery thrillers. Another common subgenre of thriller is the spy genre which deals with fictional espionage. Successful examples of thrillers are the films of Alfred Hitchcock.","target":"What are the names of some [Thriller] films?","rationale":"The answer to the original question is \\"the casino job, follow me!, echoes of innocence...\\".

Only a handful of humans have survived the apocalypse, while the rest have changed into mutants who roam the radioactive wastelands. Eventually, humanity's true ancestors  – fairies, elves and dwarves – resurfaced and live in the idyllic land of Montagar in peace for three millennia. \\nWhile her people celebrated 3,000 years of peace, their ruler Delia, queen of the fairies, fell into a trance and left the party.

Recently there has been something of a recovery in cycling , and in many areas it is a very useful way of getting around , especially where bike paths or bike routes have been built . You may well want to buy , hire or borrow a bike .\\nThere are two important results of this earlier drop in cycling in the USA . One is that many people do not know how to cycle . That is , cyclists often behave more like walkers than motorists : they ride in the sidewalk or on the wrong side of the road ; they do not care for stop signs or traffic lights ; they ride without lights at night ; they give no signals .\\nThe other result is that cycling is regarded by many people not so much as a way of getting from one place to another but as a way of life , a form of exercise , etc . As a result , large numbers of young Americans have ten-speed racing bikes . These are very high and fast and great if you are cycling long distance , riding up mountains or racing . At first , though , you may find them convenient for cycling in town , sightseeing or shopping --they are expensive , uncomfortable and hard to control until you get used to them , and unsuitable for rough stony roads .\\nThere are also ordinary bikes around . If you get hold of one of these ,you may find that the brakes  work by pedaling   backwards . This is perhaps safer than ordinary brakes when it is wet , but it seems to be less effective . This arrangement also means you can't pedal backwards in order to get the pedal in the right place for getting on or getting off .\\nQuestion: Young Americans prefer racing bikes because they   _  .\\nOptions: A: can help keep fit\\nB: are easy to learn\\nC: are safer to ride\\nD: are expensive and popular","target":"A","rationale":"The article states that many young Americans cycle for the purposes of exercise or as a way of life.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.\\n\\nEnvironmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.\\n\\nIn which case the insect would stop feeding after ingesting the crop, case A or case B?","target":"case A","rationale":"Bt toxin is naturally occurring protein, but has to become active before it can be effective as an insecticide.\\nIn case A the crop itself contains and expresses Bt toxins in its activated form, which means that once ingested by the insects they are instantly affected without delay. In contrast case B sees a spray containing Bt toxins used on crops so after ingestion of the crop the toxin must still undergo digestion from within the gut wall of insects before becoming active and causing harm - this would take some time for effects to manifest themselves. So with all else being equal (which we have no reason not to assume) case A should see quicker results than those seen in case B where both are aimed at reducing harmful chemical usage/effects upon our environment ."},{"source":"My mom has been giving Kyle and I ornaments since we were little , so we both have a big box full of ornaments .

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise...\\n\\nQuestion: How did the attack plotters avoid detection?\\nI think \\"They moved , spent , and stored their money in irregular ways\\" is a valid answer.

Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.\\n\\n- Borrowdale is a valley and civil parish in the English Lake District in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria, England.\\n\\n- A fell (from Old Norse \\"fell\\", \\"fjall\\", \\"mountain\\") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, the Isle of Man, parts of Northern England, and Scotland.\\n\\n- Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface.\\n\\n- A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- The Southern Fells are a group of hills in the English Lake District. Including Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England, they occupy a broad area to the south of Great Langdale, Borrowdale and Wasdale. High and rocky towards the centre of the Lake District, the Southern Fells progressively take on a moorland character toward the south west. In the south east are the well known Furness Fells, their heavily quarried flanks rising above Coniston Water.\\n\\n- The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, at the turn of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \\"school\\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the \\"Edinburgh Review\\". They are considered part of the Romantic Movement.\\n\\n- A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\n\\n- Alfred Wainwright (\\"A.W.\\") MBE (17 January 1907  20 January 1991) was a British fellwalker, guidebook author and illustrator. His seven-volume \\"Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells\\", published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the fells of the English Lake District. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the Coast to Coast Walk, a 192-mile long-distance footpath devised by Wainwright which remains popular today.\\n\\n- William Wordsworth (7 April 1770  23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798).\\n\\n- A national mapping agency is an organisation, usually publicly owned, that produces topographic maps and geographic information of a country. Some national mapping agencies also deal with cadastral matters.\\n\\n- A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Scafell Pike or is the highest mountain in England, at an elevation of above sea level. It is located in the Lake District National Park, in Cumbria, and is part of the Southern Fells.\\nTopography.\\nScafell Pike is one of a horseshoe of high fells, open to the south, surrounding the head of Eskdale, Cumbria. It stands on the western side of the cirque, with Scafell to the south and Great End to the north. This ridge forms the watershed between Eskdale and Wasdale, which lies to the west.\\n\\n- The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.\\n\\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- A pyramid (from \\"\\") is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape, meaning that a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.\\n\\n- Wasdale is a valley and civil parish in the western part of the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. The River Irt flows through the valley to its estuary at Ravenglass. A large part of the main valley floor is occupied by Wastwater, the deepest lake in England (258 feet). The population of Wasdale was only minimal and, from the 2011 Census is included in the parish of Gosforth.\\n\\n- Coniston Water in Cumbria is the third largest lake in the English Lake District. It is five miles long by half a mile wide (8 km by 800 m), has a maximum depth of 184 feet (56 m), and covers an area of . The lake has an elevation of 143 feet (44 m) above sea level. It drains to the sea via the River Crake.\\n\\n- The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France. It is a tri-national facility operated by France, Germany and the United States.\\n\\n- Ordnance Survey (OS) is the national mapping agency for Great Britain and is one of the world's largest producers of maps. Since 1 April 2015 it has operated as Ordnance Survey Ltd, a government-owned company, 100% in public ownership. The Ordnance Survey Board remain accountable to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It is also a member of the Public Data Group.\\n\\n- The Coast to Coast Walk is a unofficial and mostly unsignposted long-distance footpath in Northern England. Devised by Alfred Wainwright, it passes through three contrasting national parks: the Lake District National Park, the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the North York Moors National Park.\\n\\n- In geometry, a square pyramid is a pyramid having a square base. If the apex is perpendicularly above the center of the square, it will have \\"C\\" symmetry.\\n\\n- Great Langdale is a valley in the Lake District National Park in North West England, the epithet Great distinguishing it from the neighbouring valley of Little Langdale.\\n\\n- A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.\\n\\n- A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.\\n\\n- The Furness Fells are those hills and mountains in the Furness region of Cumbria, England. Historically part of Lancashire, the Furness Fells or High Furness is the name given to the upland part of Furness, that is, that part of Furness lying north of the line between Ulverston and Ireleth. The hills lie largely within the English Lake District.\\n\\n- The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North-West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or \\"fells\\") and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'bowfell' exhibits the relationship of 'located in the administrative territorial entity'.

Anemia was induced in nine healthy male subjects by repeated venesections. The stored blood was retransfused after 9 wk (range 8-11 wk). Exercise tests were performed before venesection in the control state (C), in the anemic state (A), and 48 h after retransfusion (R). Hemoglobin concentration levels were 146 +/- 10 g/l in C, 110 +/- 7 g/l in A, and 145 +/- 9 g/l in R. Maximal O2 uptake was 4.55 +/- 0.6, 3.74 +/- 0.7, and 4.45 +/- 0.6 l/min in C, A, and R, respectively. A decrease in heart rate of 7 beats/min (P less than 0.01) and in cardiac output of 2 l/min (P less than 0.05) at maximal exercise occurred in the anemic state compared with control values. These decreases were not reversed but, rather, were further accentuated after retransfusion. The adaptive response to submaximal exercise (cycling at 150-175 W) in anemia was mediated to the amount of 50% by an increase in cardiac output (mainly an increase in heart rate) and 50% was due to increased O2 extraction in the peripheral tissue. In conclusion, long-term anemia was found to decrease the heart rate and cardiac output at maximal exercise.

In 2005, there was an increment of 15%, which would make the new population 1,400,000 * (100% + 15%) = 1,610,000. In 2006 there was a decrement of 35%, which would mean that the city lost 35% of its total population; this means that it gained 65% instead. Thus the new population is:1 610 000 * (100% + 65%) = 2 665 500\\\\nIn 2007 there was an increment of 45%. This means that we did not lose any people and only gained 45%.

The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) from its headquarters in Kathmandu.

It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators, built in 1956. Martyr's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year. The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nI am humble and calm person. and i trust everyone easily. in my office i have huge friends. but i speak with particular friend. then one day a new employee joint to our office. he looks so innocent. i see him as me. so i give a company to him. and talk with him. we become very close. then after some days passed we become very thick friend. one day he cheated me in money.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point.\\nWe spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her.

Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’.\\nWe separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why.

Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.\\n\\n- Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609  10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I.

They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, the longest and widest being Padre Island of Texas. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends, and basement controls.\\n\\n- The Chincoteague Pony, also known as the Assateague horse, is a breed of pony that developed and lives in a feral condition on Assateague Island in the United States states of Virginia and Maryland. The breed was made famous by the \\"Misty of Chincoteague\\" series written by Marguerite Henry starting in 1947. While phenotypically horse-like, they are commonly called \\"ponies\\". This is due in part to their smaller stature, created by the poor habitat on Assateague Island. Variation is found in their physical characteristics due to blood from different breeds being introduced at various points in their history. They can be any solid color, and are often found in pinto patterns, which are a favorite with breed enthusiasts. Island Chincoteagues live on a diet of salt marsh plants and brush. This poor-quality and often scarce food combined with uncontrolled inbreeding created a propensity for conformation faults in the Chincoteague before outside blood was added beginning in the early 20th century.\\n\\n- Padre Island is the largest of the Texas barrier islands and is the world's longest barrier island. It is part of the U.S. state of Texas. The island is located along Texas' southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches at the south end. Meaning \\"father\\" in Spanish, it was named after Father José Nicolás Ballí (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County.\\n\\n- Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as \\"roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb\\". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By the end of the eighteenth century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an \\"obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom\\"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that \\"all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception.\\" By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, received instructions from Treasury officials to clear the old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame.

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder.\\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.\\n\\nand a hint : Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which sample would have higher percentage of uranium-235, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample B","rationale":"The nuclear scientist has an enriched uranium sample (sample B) and a naturally occurring uranium sample(sample A).

Enrichment increases the percent content of U-235 by separating out other isotopes like U-238 from the mixture through physical methods such as diffusion or centrifugation.\\nIn conclusion, since enrichment generally raises the amount of Uranium-235 to at least 3%, we can infer that sample A likely does not contain much more than 1%.

Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll.

It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\\n\\n- Protobactrites is an extinct nautiloid cephalopod belonging to the Orthoceratoidea that lived in what would be Europe and Asia during the Ordovician and Silurian from 466 -- 421.3 mya , existing for approximately 44.7 million years .\\n\\n- The Ascocerida are comparatively small, bizarre Orthoceratoids known only from Ordovician and Silurian sediments in Europe and North America, uniquely characterized by a deciduous conch consisting of a longiconic juvenile portion and an inflated breviconic adult portion that separate sometime in maturity.\\n\\n- The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician-Silurian extinction event when 60% of marine species were wiped out.\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- The Lituitida are the Lituitidae of the Treatise (Furnish & Glenister,1964), reranked as an order and combined with other orthoceratoids. They are considered to be more closely related to the Orthocerida than to the Ascocerida or Pseudorthocerida which are also included. \\n\\n- The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\\nThe first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment.\\n\\n- Pseudorthocerida is an order of generally straight longiconic Orthoceratoids with a subcentral to marginal cyrtochoanitic siphuncle composed of variably expanded segments which may contain internal deposits that may develop into a continuous parietal lining.(Sweet 1964). Cameral deposits are common and concentrated ventrally. Apices typically have a slight to moderate exogastric curvature \\n\\n- The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress.\\n\\n- The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.\\n\\n- Orthocerida is an order of extinct Orthoceratoid cephalopods also known as the Michelinocerda that lived from the Early Ordovician possibly to the Late Triassic. A fossil found in the Caucasus suggests they may even have survived until the Early Cretaceous. They were most common however from the Ordovician to the Devonian.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- Orthoceratoidea is a subclass, formerly considered an infraclass or a superorder (Wade 1988), that comprises Cephalopoda orders that have orthoconic to slightly cyrtoconic shells and central to subcentral siphuncles in which there may be internal deposits. Currently, Orthoceratoidea comprises the orders Dissidocerida, Ascocerida, Pseudorthocerida, Lituitida and Orthocerida.\\n\\n- The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'protobactrites' and 'orthocerida'?","target":"parent taxon","rationale":"The rationale is that \\"Orthocerida\\" is a parent taxon to the extinct nautiloid cephalopod Protobactrites."},{"source":"Short general knowledge question: in what country is amsterdam?","target":"Netherlands","rationale":"The answer should be Netherlands.\\nAmsterdam is the capital city of The Netherlands which also has other cities such as Rotterdam, Utrecht and Hague."},{"source":"Given a question, generate a paraphrase of that question wihout changing the meaning of it.

The Patriots received the ball to start the game and six plays in, converted a 3rd-and-8 to keep the drive alive. On the next play, Brady threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Moss to take an early 7-0 lead. Brady was injured on the play and went to the locker room but returned by the next offensive snap. In the mean time, the Dolphins' first possession reached the Patriots' 42-yard line before Henne was sacked by Banta-Cain and Mayo for a loss of seven yards. On the next play, the Dolphins used White in their \\"pistol\\" formation and attempted a play action option run, but White's option toss to Ricky Williams was errant and recovered by Williams for a loss of 13 yards. Following the Dolphins' punt, the Patriots began a 13-play, 80-yard drive with 6:41 left in the first quarter and did not surrender the ball until early in the second quarter, extending their lead to 14-0 on a 6-yard Faulk draw for a touchdown. The Dolphins responded with a 10-play, 88-yard drive of their own, including a 29-yard pass to Camarillo, that ended in a 13-yard touchdown pass from Henne to Davone Bess, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14-7. Despite a 16-yard Welker reception to begin the Patriots' next drive, they were forced to punt after four plays. The Dolphins again moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing possession, reaching the 49-yard line before Henne was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 19-yard line. Following a 19-yard return, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Wilfork, and a false start penalty on Watson, the Patriots' next drive began at their own 18-yard line. The Patriots quickly moved into the red zone on a 58-yard Welker catch, but on a 4th-and-1 from the 6-yard line, the Patriots tried to convert, and Morris was stopped short of the first down marker. Off the turnover and with under two minutes remaining, the Dolphins moved 83 yards on 11 plays, cutting the Patriots' halftime lead to 14-10 on a 29-yard Carpenter field goal. The Dolphins, who had deferred the opening coin toss, chose to receive at the start of the second half but went three-and-out. On the next play (after a penalty), Brady threw a short sideline pass to Aiken, who caught the ball over the defender and proceeded to run down the sideline for an 81-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 21-10. It was the third 50+ yard completion of the game for Brady, a career first, and the third longest completion of Brady's career. He also eclipsed 30,000 career passing yards on the play. Following a 51-yard kickoff return by Ted Ginn, Jr., the Dolphins took two plays to reach Patriots territory. On a 3rd-and-4 from the Patriots' 46-yard line, Henne attempted a deep sideline pass to wide receiver Brian Hartline, who stopped and turned back to catch the ball but was taken down by Wilhite for a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty. However, the Pats surrendered only three yards and forced the Dolphins to kick a field goal; Carpenter's 24-yard score cut the Patriots' lead to 21-13. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins continued to pressure the Patriots defense, moving 64 yards on 12 plays and cutting the deficit to two points on a 7-yard Hartline touchdown catch. The Dolphins attempted to tie the game on a two-point conversion pass attempt to Fasano, but the pass fell incomplete. The Patriots' next drive reached the Dolphins' 39-yard line, where the Patriots again attempted to convert a fourth down, this one with three yards to gain. The Patriots appeared to do so at first, as Welker caught a 13-yard pass from Brady, but the play was nullified by an Aiken offensive pass interference penalty. After another penalty on the first punt attempt, the second punt attempt by Hanson actually gave the Patriots a better break, pinning the Dolphins at their own 3-yard line at the end of the third quarter. The Dolphins could not move past their 22-yard line on the ensuing possession and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 39-yard line. After several quick first downs, the Patriots reached the red zone. However, a Brady pass attempt intended for Moss in the back corner of the end zone was intercepted by Vontae Davis for a touchback, maintaining a two-point deficit for the Dolphins. However, the Dolphins could not move a yard off the turnover and were forced to punt; the Patriots too went three-and-out. The Dolphins moved to the Patriots' 39-yard line on their ensuing possession, and like the Patriots, faced a fourth down with two yards to go. Henne's pass intended for Bess was broken up by Butler to turn the ball over on downs. However, the Patriots did not gain a yard, and in fact lost one yard on their next possession, setting up a Dolphins possession with 3:44 left in the game. The Dolphins moved 51 yards on 10 plays, reaching the Patriots' 23-yard line with just over one minute remaining. Carpenter then hit a 41-yard field goal to put the Dolphins ahead for the first time in the game, 22-21. Only needing a field goal, the Patriots tried to set up a Gostkowski attempt with under a minute to go, but three plays into their drive Brady was hit as he threw and was intercepted by linebacker Channing Crowder to seal a Dolphins victory. The back-to-back losses were a first for the Patriots since November 2006, and dropped their record to 7-5, while the Dolphins improved to 6-6 and within a game of first place in the division.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

He carefully plans every minute of both his professional  and personal time. But on his way home for the holidays, the small plane he's in crashes in the Pacific Ocean. Only Noland survives. He ends up alone on a tropical island and begins a battle for survival. In the process, his view of success and life itself change dramatically .\\nThis role may be the most physically-challenging of Hank's career. The actor lost 53 pounds for the part. Director Robert Zemeckis shot the first section of the film with Hanks weighing more than 225 pounds. The filming took a break  for a year while Hanks lost weight. To take off the pounds, Hanks ate little and exercised a lot.\\nThe movie may surprise some of Hank's fans. It's not an upbeat comedy like Sleepless in Seattle or You're Got Mail.

Although lt has been living in the cloud forests of South Amcrica for some time.\\nScientists say the olinguito is the first new carnivore discovered In the Americas in more than 30 years. It is a hairy orange-brown creature with a sweet face and big eyes The animal has small. rounded ears and lives in the trees An adult weighs one kilogram and measures about 75 centimeters. with half of those centimeters taken up by its ringed tail Most of the time. it likes to eat fruit, although it also eats meat. Active at night, the animal has lived in Colombia and Ecuador for a long time. But the olinguito did not exist in science books before now.\\nKristofer Helgen, director at the National Museum in Washington, led the research team that confirmed the existence of the olinguito. It had been mistaken more than a century ago for a look-alike animal -- a similar but larger olingo . Mr. Helgen had been studying olingos in a museum for ten years. At that time. he observed a difference in the size and shape of the heads and teeth. That led him on an effort to prove he was looking at an animal never before described by science. He got lucky when he communicated with a zoologist in Ecuador. The animal expert there made a short video that shows an olinguito in the trees. The video confirms that the oiinguito is different from the olingo     Mr. Helgen says tens of thousands of olinguitos live in the wild and are not in danger of disappearing forever. Human beings, however, are moving closer to the olinguito habitat in the Andean cloud forests.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\"","target":"Etty","rationale":"The context above provides information about the painter William Etty, who was born in York and grew up to become an artist. He is most well known for his paintings of nude figures, which drew some criticism due to their content being considered indecent.\\nOne such work he created depicts Ulysses encountering the Sirens from Homer's Odyssey .

The tenor (higher) voice was Sam Moore (born 1935) and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was Dave Prater (1937-1988). Sam & Dave are members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and are Grammy Award and multiple gold record award-winning artists.\\n\\nWhen Sam & Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer & engineer Jim Stewart and songwriters including the MGs' guitarist Steve Cropper, who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo's biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the Soul Men LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo's singing style, and shifted their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today.  Sam & Dave's Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and the Stax horn section, the Mar-Keys, were world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings--the same musicians who recorded with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Carla Thomas and other soul artists. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder Jim Stewart, who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song.  While the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) \\"You Don't Know Like I Know\\" hit #7 R&B in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B chart appearances during their career.\\n\\nWhat was their most popular song?","target":"This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B chart appearances during their career.","rationale":"The answer is provided in the context.

Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.","target":"Long","rationale":"The passage mentions that Long Island is full of people who use all their natural resources, including burning fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Snail Island has fewer residents and protects the environment by not cutting down trees or using up its natural resources. Because it has so many more people than Snail island, we can assume that there are also far more factories on Long Island as well.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The context establishes that Y. pestis was present in the mass graves, so the answer to both variants of the question would be \\"Yes\\"."},{"source":"Answer the following question.\\nPrince Escalus, the Prince of Verona appears in which Shakespeare play?","target":"Romeo & Juliette","rationale":"The answer is Romeo & Juliette."},{"source":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math.

It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia. Unveiled in 1935, the 42-metre (138 ft) high monument of granite, travertine, and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.\\nThe sculptures and bas-reliefs of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a 19-metre (62 ft) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \\"memorial column\\". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme \\"Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!\\" (\\"Shine like a star!\\") submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle. Construction works were financed by private donations.\\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered it to be of high artistic value. In 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was dismissed by Soviet authorities as the destruction of the building would have caused deep indignation and tension in society. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America.  When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia.  He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family.  Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture.  Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.  This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot.  Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.\\nThe training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period.\\nQuestion: Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners?\\nOptions:\\n- not enough information\\n- the runners had a regimen to begin with\\n- it was easier to study\\n- it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes","target":"it allowed for a more accurate assessment of any changes","rationale":"The researchers used a set training schedule in order to accurately assess the effects of each treatment on performance.

There were 114 males and 30 females with a mean age of 28.6 years. The total time of followup was 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months). Indications for splenectomy were blunt trauma, 111 patients; penetrating trauma, six patients; and intra-operative injury, 27 patients. During the followup to date, 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization have occurred in 13 patients (9%). Fulminant pneumococcal sepsis resulted in the death of a 27-year-old male, 3 years after splenectomy. Septicemia occurred in four patients, pneumonia in five, abscess in two, infection of a prosthetic heart valve in one, meningitis in one, and fever of unknown origin in one. All but two of these infections were due to encapsulated organisms. Minor septic complications occurred in 44 patients (30%), and consisted of infections which required outpatient medical care. Major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (18.5% and 5.9% respectively; p less than 0.05). The mortality from major septic complications in this series (7%) is lower than previously reported by other investigators (30-80%). Our data suggest that adults undergoing splenectomy for trauma are at an increased risk of developing late major septic complications. This risk is significant enough to warrant attempts at splenic salvage, especially when injury is incidental to an elective operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical values and measurements, such as the mean age of 28.6 years, the total time of followup of 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months), 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization occurring in 13 patients (9%), and 18.5% and 5.9% respectively indicating that major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (p less than 0.05).

More than one year later, all diplomatic means having been exhausted, on 10 July 1739 King George II authorised the Admiralty Board to seek maritime reprisals against Spain. On 20 July, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a fleet of warships departed Britain, bound for the West Indies, to attack Spanish ships and \\"possessions\\". War was not declared against Spain until Saturday, 23 October 1739 , one day after the attack on La Guaira, the principal port of the Province of Venezuela, which was controlled by the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. After arriving at the island of Antigua in early October 1739, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish merchant ships that made the route between La Guaira and Porto Bello. Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan. The governor of the Province of Venezuela, Brigadier Don Gabriel de Zuloaga had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his ruse; they waited until the British squadron was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs. Trying later to explain his actions, Waterhouse argued that the capture of a few small Spanish vessels would not have justified the loss of his men.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: What happened first: George II seeked maritime reprisals against Spain or Waterhouse entered the port La Guaira?","target":"George II seeked maritime reprisals against Spain","rationale":"To solve the problem \\"What happened first: George II seeked maritime reprisals against Spain or Waterhouse entered the port La Guaira?\\", we need to compare when these events took place.

As for Waterhouse, it is mentioned that he entered La Guaira in October of 1739 after arriving at Antigua island in early October and trying to intercept Spanish ships before entering La Guaira port.

More than one year later, all diplomatic means having been exhausted, on 10 July 1739 King George II authorised the Admiralty Board to seek maritime reprisals against Spain. On 20 July, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a fleet of warships departed Britain, bound for the West Indies, to attack Spanish ships and \\"possessions\\". War was not declared against Spain until Saturday, 23 October 1739 , one day after the attack on La Guaira, the principal port of the Province of Venezuela, which was controlled by the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. After arriving at the island of Antigua in early October 1739, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish merchant ships that made the route between La Guaira and Porto Bello. Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan. The governor of the Province of Venezuela, Brigadier Don Gabriel de Zuloaga had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his ruse; they waited until the British squadron was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs. Trying later to explain his actions, Waterhouse argued that the capture of a few small Spanish vessels would not have justified the loss of his men.\\nWho led the British warships in 1739, Don Francisco or Edward Vernon?","target":"Edward Vernon","rationale":"In order to answer who led the British warships in 1739, we first need to identify Edward Vernon and Don Francisco. To do this, it is mentioned that Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse (STEP 1) while Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo (STEP 2).

Along with the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, they were one of the first bands of the early punk rock scenes. Although their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band's first two albums--New York Dolls (1973) and Too Much Too Soon (1974)--became among the most popular cult records in rock.\\n\\nBy 1975 the Dolls were playing smaller venues than they had been previously. Drug and alcohol abuse by Thunders, Nolan and Kane as well as artistic differences added to the tensions among members. In late February or early March Malcolm McLaren became their informal manager. He got the band red leather outfits to wear on stage and a communist flag as backdrop. The Dolls did a 5-concert tour of New York's five boroughs, supported by Television and Pure Hell. The Little Hippodrome (Manhattan) show was recorded and released by Fan Club records in 1982 as Red Patent Leather. It was originally a bootleg album that was later remixed by Sylvain, with former manager Marty Thau credited as executive producer. Due to Kane being unable to play that night, roadie Peter Jordan played bass, though he was credited as having played \\"second bass\\". Jordan filled in for Kane when he was too inebriated to play.  In March and April McClaren took the band on a tour of South Carolina and Florida. Jordan replaced Kane for most of those shows. Thunders and Nolan left after an argument with Johansen.

Meanwhile, it seems that the boyfriend has already spent over $1000 on rent and other expenses while he was away, which could have been spent on his own medical care or given to his girlfriend for use in driving him around during his business trip.\\\\nIt appears that the author of this anecdote (the girlfriend) has a legitimate reason for not wanting to make such a long drive during winter weather: namely, fear for her personal safety; however, her concerns are dismissed by her aggressive boyfriend who demands repeatedly that she \\"do what you need\\" without listening or considering how badly off financially they both are at present.

Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium.

Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and  grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \\"Herb\\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \\"Maisie\\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14.\\n\\nGleason did two Jackie Gleason Show specials for CBS after giving up his regular show in the 1970s, including Honeymooners segments and a Reginald Van Gleason III sketch in which the gregarious millionaire was portrayed as an alcoholic. When the CBS deal expired, Gleason signed with NBC. He later did a series of Honeymooners specials for ABC. Gleason hosted four ABC specials during the mid-1970s. Gleason and Carney also made a television movie, Izzy and Moe (1985), about an unusual pair of historic Federal prohibition agents in New York City who achieved an unbeatable arrest record with highly successful techniques including impersonsations and humor, which aired on CBS in 1985.  In April 1974, Gleason revived several of his classic characters (including Ralph Kramden, Joe the Bartender and Reginald Van Gleason III) in a television special with Julie Andrews. In a song-and-dance routine, the two performed \\"Take Me Along\\" from Gleason's Broadway musical.  In 1985, three decades after the \\"Classic 39\\" began filming, Gleason revealed he had carefully preserved kinescopes of his live 1950s programs in a vault for future use (including Honeymooners sketches with Pert Kelton as Alice). These \\"lost episodes\\" (as they came to be called) were initially previewed at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City, aired on the Showtime cable network in 1985, and later added to the Honeymooners syndication package. Some of them include earlier versions of plot lines later used in the 'classic 39' episodes.

So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two different countries produced their electricity using different methods.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- The Athena Promachos (   \`\` Athena who fights in the front line '' ) was a colossal bronze statue of Athena sculpted by Pheidias , which stood between the Propylaea and the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens . Athena was the goddess of wisdom and warriors and the protectress of Athens . Pheidias also sculpted two other figures of Athena on the Acropolis , the huge gold and ivory ( \`\` chryselephantine '' ) cult image of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon and the Lemnian Athena . The designation Athena Promachos is not attested before a dedicatory inscription of the early fourth century CE : Pausanias ( 1.28.2 ) , for one , referred to it as \`\` the great bronze Athena '' on the Acropolis .\\n\\n- The Parthenon ( \\"Parthenónas\\") is a former temple, on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438 BC although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, Athenian democracy and western civilization, and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. The Greek Ministry of Culture is currently carrying out a programme of selective restoration and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure.\\n\\n- Phidias or Pheidias (\\"Pheidias\\"; c. 480  430 BC) was a Greek sculptor, painter, and architect. His statue of Zeus at Olympia was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Phidias also designed the statues of the goddess Athena on the Athenian Acropolis, namely the \\"Athena Parthenos\\" inside the Parthenon, and the \\"Athena Promachos\\", a colossal bronze which stood between it and the Propylaea, a monumental gateway that served as the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. Phidias was the son of Charmides of Athens. The ancients believed that his masters were Hegias and Ageladas.\\n\\n- In ancient Greece and during the Byzantine era, the Promachoi (singular: Promachos; Greek: ) were the men fighting in the first rank of the phalanx. The word can also be used as an adjective as in \\"promachos line\\" referring to the first line of battle. It may also refer to \\"Athena Promachos\\", the famous bronze statue by Phidias that towered over the Parthenon.\\n\\n- The Brandenburg Gate is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin, and one of the best-known landmarks of Germany.

The goal is to learn to map from one molecular graph to another with better properties based on an available corpus of paired molecules. Since molecules can be optimized in different ways, there are multiple viable translations for each input graph. A key challenge is therefore to model diverse translation outputs. Our primary contributions include a junction tree encoder-decoder for learning diverse graph translations along with a novel adversarial training method for aligning distributions of molecules. Diverse output distributions in our model are explicitly realized by low-dimensional latent vectors that modulate the translation process.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\".... contains an answer for the question: What books of the Bible are the prescribed readings for the feast day taken from?, what is it ?","target":"Acts of the Apostles","rationale":"A brief introduction is given to the cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder.

In the areas of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and pregnancy, lifestyle factors influence oocyte production, fertilization rates, pregnancy and pregnancy loss, while chronic, low-grade oxidative stress may underlie poor outcomes for some IVF cases.   \\n METHODS Here, we review the current literature and present some original, previously unpublished data, obtained from couples attending the PIVET Medical Centre in Western Australia.   \\n RESULTS During the study, 80 % of females and 70 % of male partners completed a 1-week diary documenting their smoking, alcohol and fruit and vegetable intake. The subsequent clinical outcomes of their IVF treatment such as quantity of oocytes collected, fertilization rates, pregnancy and pregnancy loss were submitted to multiple regression analysis, in order to investigate the relationship between patients, treatment and the recorded lifestyle factors. Of significance, it was found that male smoking caused an increased risk of pregnancy loss (p = 0.029), while female smoking caused an adverse effect on ovarian reserve. Both alcohol consumption (β = 0.074, p < 0.001) and fruit and vegetable consumption (β = 0.034, p < 0.001) had positive effects on fertilization.   \\n CONCLUSION Based on our results and the current literature, there is an important impact of lifestyle factors on IVF clinical outcomes. Currently, there are conflicting results regarding other lifestyle factors such as nutritional habits and alcohol consumption, but it is apparent that chronic oxidative stress induced by lifestyle factors and poor nutritional habits associate with a lower rate of IVF success.","target":"The effect of cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and fruit and vegetable consumption on IVF outcomes: a review and presentation of original data","rationale":"The title of the article should be concise and provide an overview of its main idea.

These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4]\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match.

EQ-5D was employed to measure the HRQoL. The likelihood that individuals with selected chronic diseases would report any problem in the EQ-5D dimensions was calculated and tested relative to that of each of the two reference groups. Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate factors associated with EQ VAS.   \\n RESULTS The most frequently reported problems involved pain/discomfort (8.8%) and anxiety/depression (7.6%). Nearly half of the respondents who reported problems in any of the five dimensions were chronic patients. Higher EQ VAS scores were associated with the male gender, higher level of education, employment, younger age, an urban area of residence, access to free medical service and higher levels of physical activity. Except for anemia, all the selected chronic diseases were indicative of a negative EQ VAS score. The three leading risk factors were cerebrovascular disease, cancer and mental disease. Increases in age, number of chronic conditions and frequency of physical activity were found to have a gradient effect.   \\n CONCLUSION The results of the present work add to the volume of knowledge regarding population health status in this area, apart from the known health status using mortality and morbidity data. Medical, policy, social and individual attention should be given to the management of chronic diseases and improvement of HRQoL. Longitudinal studies must be performed to monitor changes in HRQoL and to permit evaluation of the outcomes of chronic disease intervention programs.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the aim of the study, relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.\\n\\n- An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .\\n\\n- A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").\\n\\n- The romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the mass-market literary genre. Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an \\"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\\" There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction. Walter Scott defined the literary fiction form of romance as \\"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\\".\\n\\n- Jilly Cooper OBE (born 21 February 1937) is an English author. She began her career as a journalist and wrote numerous works of non-fiction before writing several romance novels, the first of which appeared in 1975. She is most famous for writing the \\"Rutshire Chronicles\\".\\n\\n- Rupert Edward Algernon Campbell-Black is a fictional character in the Rutshire Chronicles series of romance novels written by Jilly Cooper. He is the great-great-great-great-great-great grandson of Rupert Black (who married Miss Campbell). Campbell-Black's first appearance is in the novel \\"Riders\\", which follows the lives and loves of a group of horse riders and show-jumpers. Although initially portrayed as a brutish, womanizing, adulterous cad, Campbell-Black's character is later somewhat redeemed through his triumphant winning of an Olympic gold medal for Great Britain. His loyalty is also highlighted through his friendships with Billy Lloyd-Foxe, Ricky France-Lynch and Declan O'Hara, as well as his gentle courtship of his second wife Agatha 'Taggie' O'Hara. He has five children: Marcus and Tabitha from his marriage with Helen Macaulay, adopted children Xavier and Bianca with Taggie, and the illegitimate Perdita.\\n\\n- Self-publishing is the publication of any book or other media by its author without the involvement of an established publisher. A self-published physical book is said to have been privately printed. The author is in control of the entire process including, for a book, the design of the cover and interior, formats, price, distribution, marketing, and public relations. The authors can do it all themselves or may outsource some or all the work to companies which offer these services.\\n\\n- The Rutshire Chronicles is the name given to a series of romantic novels by Jilly Cooper. The stories tell tales of mainly British upper-class families, as well as the show-jumping and polo crowd, in numerous different sexually charged scenarios, often laced with adultery, illegitimate children, scandal, and sometimes, even death. They are linked by several recurring characters, chiefly Rupert Campbell-Black, and are set in the fictional English county of Rutshire, not to be confused with the real English county of Rutland. \\n\\n- Rivals is a novel by the English author Jilly Cooper . It is the second of the Rutshire Chronicles , a series of books set in the fictional English county of Rutshire .\\n\\n- A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\\n\\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\\n\\n- Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era.\\n\\n- An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.\\n\\n- A scandal can be broadly defined as an accusation or accusations that receive wide exposure. Generally there is a negative effect on the credibility of the person or organisation involved. Society is scandalised when it is made aware of blatant breaches of moral norms or legal requirements. In contemporary times, exposure is often made by mass media. Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust or the abuse of power. Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary or artistic but often spread from one realm into another. The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. \\nContemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and acts detrimental to their establishments. However, the possibility of scandal has always created a tension between society's efforts to reveal wrongdoing and its desire to cover them up.\\n\\n- A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.\\n\\n- Adultery (anglicised from Latin \\"adulterium\\") is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.\\n\\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\\n\\n- Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'rivals ' with the relationship of 'genre'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- book\\n - christianity\\n - country\\n - design\\n - essays\\n - fantasy\\n - fiction\\n - horse\\n - information\\n - japanese\\n - judaism\\n - literary fiction\\n - marketing\\n - narrative\\n - news\\n - novel\\n - novella\\n - paranormal\\n - poetry\\n - prose\\n - renaissance\\n - romance\\n - romance novel\\n - romance novels\\n - romantic\\n - sexual\\n - society\\n - universe\\n - variety\\n - various\\n - video","target":"romance novel","rationale":"The best answer here is \\"romance novel\\"."},{"source":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.

A few reports have suggested, however, that a genetic component may contribute to the incidence of GER, especially in its severe or chronic forms.   \\n OBJECTIVE To identify a genetic locus that cosegregates with a severe pediatric GER phenotype in families with multiple affected members.   \\n DESIGN A genome-wide scan of families affected by severe pediatric GER using polymorphic microsatellite markers spaced at an average of 8 centimorgans (cM), followed by haplotyping and by pairwise and multipoint linkage analyses.   \\n SETTING General US community, with research performed in a university tertiary care hospital.    SUBJECTS Affected and unaffected family members from 5 families having multiple individuals affected by severe pediatric GER, identified through a patient support group.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Determination of inheritance patterns and linkage of a genetic locus with the severe pediatric GER phenotype by logarithm-of-odds (lod) score analysis, considering a lod score of 3 or greater as evidence of linkage.   \\n RESULTS In these families, severe pediatric GER followed an autosomal dominant hereditary pattern with high penetrance. A gene for severe pediatric GER was mapped to a 13-cM region on chromosome 13q between microsatellite markers D13S171 and D13S263.

It's only 10 0'clock.\\"\\nMother: \\"Yes. I went to her room and she was asleep.\\"\\nThe mother knows that Mary is asleep because she went into her room and saw her.\\nHere is another case. Two friends decide to telephone Mary.\\nJack: \\"Let's telephone Mary. It's 10 0'clock.\\"\\nJill: \\"No. It's too late. She will be asleep now.\\"\\nJill knows that Mary always goes to bed before 10 o'clock, so now she'll probably be asleep. But it is also possible that she is staying up late.\\nQuestion: In the second situation, Jill   _  .\\nAnswer:","target":"thinks it's possible that Mary cannot answer the telephone","rationale":"In the second situation, Jill thinks it's possible that Mary cannot answer the telephone."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a context sentence containing a blank (_).

They obtain moisture from the air and make food by photosynthesis. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in tropical or temperate rainforests (see Figure below ). Host trees provide support, allowing epiphyte plants to obtain air and sunlight high above the forest floor. Being elevated above the ground lets epiphytes get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores and increase the chance of pollination by wind.\\n\\nWhile hiking Bob likes to collect plant specimens. Yesterday, he was hiking along a creek, and was specifically looking for epiphytes. Eventually, he found one, and tagged the specimen as specimen A. To compare specimen A with another plant he collected another plant specimen that was not an epiphyte. He tagged that specimen as specimen B.\\n\\nWhich specimen may not get the benefit of its elevation for pollination, specimen A or specimen B?","target":"specimen B","rationale":"The context mentions that epiphytes are elevated above the ground, which benefits them by allowing them to get out of shadows and increasing the chance at pollination. Therefore, Specimen A is an epiphyte so it would benefit from its elevation through increased chances of pollination by wind.
