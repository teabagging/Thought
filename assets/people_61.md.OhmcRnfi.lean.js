Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes several sections that present numerical data, such as the specific binding affinity (KD around 20 pM), decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density for subjects with mild-to-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction (38.2% and 57.7%, respectively), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40 and LVEF less than 0.20), dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, etc., so the answer is “Yes”.\\",\\n\\n)\\n\\n  end\\nend"},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: But as soon as we get closer , we find the elevator powered down , and all the gates locked .

You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure .\\n    For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous.\\n    Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300.\\n    A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350.\\n    For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500.\\n    Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears   ---and tend to be heavier, too.

Throughout the 1930s, the study was his base for the writing of many of his most successful books.

The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Anna Torv. Olivia is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as an FBI Special Agent, working for a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. Having grown up with an abusive stepfather, Olivia struggles with the unexpected changes in her life, following her encounter with mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop, and his son and an eventual love interest for her, Peter Bishop.\\n\\nThe character of Olivia has been described as \\"an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel[ed] back over time.\\" She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career \\"pretty much since [she] was nine\\", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.  In the reset timeline for the series' fourth season, Torv explained that \\"The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and had all this time to get used to it and work out that this is her life,\\" rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, \\"when Lincoln comes in, she's a little more open to him [than she was with Peter] and working with someone again.\\"  Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister Rachel, and Rachel's daughter Ella. Olivia was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott, and his supposed betrayal and death was something she dealt with for much of the first season. In the second season finale, Olivia and Peter Bishop finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss. Fauxlivia was involved in a serious relationship with Frank Stanton and eventually became engaged, but the two broke up when he discovered she was pregnant by Peter. Olivia was in a relationship with Peter after they mended things in episode 6B But shortly after that Peter built a bridge wiping himself from existence, causing Olivia to forget who he was. But through the cortexiphan and the power of their love, she soon remembered her life with him. They were married and have a daughter. In episodes 4.19 Letters of Transit and 5.1 Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11, their daughter finds them and reunites them.\\n\\nHow do others perceive her?","target":"She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work.","rationale":"The context reveals Olivia Dunham's character traits and background information.

The remaining 51 patients initially had subclinical disease; 13 (25%) of these patients progressed to classic kala-azar (mean, five months). The others (75%) resolved their illness after a prolonged period (mean, 35 months). The initial illness in the subclinical group was characterized by hepatomegaly, frequent splenomegaly, intermittent cough, diarrhea, and low-grade fever. Malaise and poor weight gain were common. Giemsa-stained smears and cultures of bone marrow aspirates were usually negative for Leishmania in the absence of symptoms of classic kala-azar.","target":"New perspectives on a subclinical form of visceral leishmaniasis","rationale":"The title should convey the key focus of the paper.

In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron.

During this period, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205). Meanwhile, the Han Empire's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo, and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords, some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court. Eventually, one of those warlords, Cao Cao, was able to gradually reunify the empire, ostensibly under Emperor Xian's rule, but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao's efforts to completely reunite the Han empire were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209, when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao's son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state, Cao Wei. A year later, in response to Cao Pi's usurpation of the Han throne, Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han; and in 229, Sun Quan followed suit, declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu. The period from Emperor Xian's abdication in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 was known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.\\n\\n- Dong Zhuo (died 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a politician and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it was in a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling and a clash between the eunuch faction and some court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and instated Emperor Xian.\\n\\n- Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.\\n\\n- Wu (222280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). It previously existed from 220222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself 'Emperor'. Its name was derived from the place it was based in  the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as \\"Wu\\". It was referred to as \\"Eastern Wu\\" or \\"Sun Wu\\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called \\"Eastern Wu\\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \\"Sun Wu\\" because the family name of its rulers was \\"Sun\\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\\n\\n- Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.\\n\\n- Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.\\n\\n- The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\".\\nIt was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD).\\n\\n- Cao Huan (246-303), courtesy name Jingming, was the fifth and last emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. In 265, he abdicated the throne in favour of Sima Yan (later Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty), and brought an end to the Wei regime. After his abdication, Cao Huan was granted the title \\"Prince of Chenliu\\" and held it until his death, after which he was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Yuan (of Cao Wei)\\".\\n\\n- Cao Rui (204 or 206  22 January 239), courtesy name Yuanzhong, was the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. His parentage is in dispute: his mother, Lady Zhen, was Yuan Xi's wife, but she later remarried Cao Pi, the first ruler of Wei. Based on conflicting accounts of his age, Pei Songzhi calculated that, in order to be Cao Pi's son, Cao Rui could not have been 36 (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died as recorded, so the recorded age was in error; Lu Bi and Mou Guangsheng argued instead that Cao Rui was Yuan Xi's son.\\n\\n- Cao Pi (187  29 June 226), courtesy name Zihuan, was the first emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. He was born in Qiao (; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) as the second son of Cao Cao, a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. However, he was the eldest son among all the children born to Cao Cao by his concubine (later wife) Lady Bian. Of all his brothers, Cao Pi was the shrewdest. Instead of focusing on academic studies or administering military affairs, he was always in the presence of court officials in order to gain their support. He was mostly in charge of defence at the start of his career. After the defeat of Cao Cao's rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he took the widow of Yuan Shao's son Yuan Xi, Lady Zhen, as a concubine, but in 221 Lady Zhen died and Guo Nüwang became empress.\\n\\n- A courtesy name (\\"zi\\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\\n\\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history.\\n\\n- Luoyang, formerly romanized as Loyang, is a city located in the confluence area of Luo River and Yellow River in Central China. It is a prefecture-level city in western Henan province. It borders the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to the east, Pingdingshan to the southeast, Nanyang to the south, Sanmenxia to the west, Jiyuan to the north, and Jiaozuo to the northeast. As of the final 2010 census, Luoyang had a population of 6,549,941 inhabitants with 1,857,003 people living in the built-up (\\"or metro\\") area made of the city's five urban districts, all of which except the Jili District are not urbanized yet.\\n\\n- Sun Quan (182252), courtesy name Zhongmou, formally known as Emperor Da of Wu (lit. \\"Great Emperor of Wu\\"), was the founder of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He inherited control of the warlord state founded by his elder brother Sun Ce in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as \\"King of Wu\\" and from 229 to 252 as the \\"Emperor of Wu\\". Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Quan governed his empire mostly separate of politics and ideology, he is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he accommodated the wills of both his rivals but only when it benefited his state of Wu and never fully attempted to conquer his rivals, although most of historians would cite his lack of logistical resources to do so.\\n\\n- Sima Yi (179  7 September 251), courtesy name Zhongda, was a general and politician of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. He is perhaps best known for defending Wei from Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions. His success and subsequent rise in prominence paved the way for his grandson Sima Yan's founding of the Jin dynasty, which would eventually bring an end to the Three Kingdoms era. In 265 after the Jin dynasty was established, Sima Yi was posthumously honoured as Emperor Xuan of Jin with the temple name of Gaozu.\\n\\n- Liaoning is a province of China, located in the northeast of the country. The modern province was established in 1907 as Fengtian or Fengtien province and the name was changed to Liaoning in 1929. It was also known as Mukden province at the time, for the Manchu pronunciation of Shengjing, the former name of the provincial capital Shenyang. Under the Japanese-puppet Manchukuo regime, the province reverted to its 1907 name but the name Liaoning was restored in 1945 and again in 1954.\\n\\n- Cao Cao (155  15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.\\n\\n- The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.\\n\\n- Cao Zhang ( died 223 ) , courtesy name Ziwen , was a prince of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period . He was a son of Cao Cao , a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han Dynasty and laid the foundation of Wei . Cao Zhang was said to have wrestled and killed wild animals with his bare hands . He was also a general under his father , having led his troops to significant victories against Wuhuan tribe incursions on the northern frontier .\\n\\n- The Northern Wei, also known as the Tuoba Wei (), Later Wei (), or Yuan Wei (), was a dynasty founded by the Tuoba clan of the Xianbei, which ruled northern China from 386 to 534 (\\"de jure\\" until 535), during the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. Described as \\"part of an era of political turbulence and intense social and cultural change\\", the Northern Wei Dynasty is particularly noted for unifying northern China in 439: this was also a period of introduced foreign ideas; such as Buddhism, which became firmly established. \\n\\n- Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.\\n\\n- Old Chinese, also called Archaic Chinese in older works, is the oldest attested stage of Chinese, and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese.\\nThe earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BC, in the late Shang dynasty.\\nBronze inscriptions became plentiful during the following Zhou dynasty.\\nThe latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature, including classical works such as the \\"Analects\\", the \\"Mencius\\", and the \\"Zuozhuan\\".\\nThese works served as models for Literary Chinese (or Classical Chinese), which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century, thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese.\\n\\n- The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states.\\n\\n- The Yellow Turban Rebellion, also translated as the Yellow Scarves Rebellion, was a peasant revolt in China against the Han dynasty. The uprising broke out in the year 184 during the reign of Emperor Ling. It took 21 years until the uprising was suppressed in the year 205. The rebellion, which got its name from the color of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebels' association with secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\".\\n\\n- The Wuhuan (Old Chinese: Ohuan, Mongol romanization:Uhuan) were a Proto-Mongolic nomadic people who inhabited northern China, in what is now the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, Shanxi, the municipality of Beijing and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'cao zhang' and '189'?","target":"date of birth","rationale":"The rationale is: \\"date of birth\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question, and your task is to predict the context of the question.

(A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy.  Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe , and in August 2007 in Australia . Players use a guitar - shaped controller ( purchased separately ) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player . Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division .\\n\\n- A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers.\\n\\n- A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. \\n\\n- Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.\\n\\n\\n\\n'guitar hero encore: rocks the 80s' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- acting\\n - action\\n - avatar\\n - band\\n - cello\\n - character\\n - classical music\\n - device\\n - entertainment\\n - feature\\n - game\\n - genre\\n - instrument\\n - music\\n - musical ensemble\\n - name\\n - performance\\n - play\\n - protagonist\\n - quartet\\n - rock\\n - rock band\\n - sequence\\n - string\\n - variety\\n - video\\n - video game\\n - wind","target":"video game","rationale":"guitar hero encore: rocks the 80s is a music rhythm game, which are classified as video games.\\nSo, guitar hero encore: rocks the 80s is related to 'video game' through the relation of instance_of."},{"source":"In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign.

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest lasting line-up. The band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s.\\n\\nOn 5 September 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard by their friend Brian May of Queen. In 2001, VH1 produced and aired Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story, a biopic that included Anthony Michael Hall as Mutt Lange and Amber Valletta as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark's girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. 18 July broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.  Def Leppard's tenth album, X, saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. X quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since Adrenalize.  An expanded and updated best-of collection, Best Of, was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, Rock of Ages - The Definitive Collection, was released the following May. Def Leppard participated at the Live 8 show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. In 2005, the band left their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and signed with HK Management.  On 23 May 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled Yeah!. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by Blondie, The Kinks, Sweet, ELO, and Badfinger among others. It debuted at No. 16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top 20 album.  The band, along with Queen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, were the inaugural inductees of VH1 Rock Honors on 31 May 2006. During the show, The All-American Rejects paid homage to the band with a cover of \\"Photograph\\". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a US tour with Journey. That October, Hysteria was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original remastered album with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases.

At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions.\\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\\nCentral to much of the impact is “access”.

Exercise training resulted in a significant increase in the mean specific activity of cyclic AMP-PDE (pmol X min-1 X mg-1) from the whole homogenate and S48 fraction at cyclic AMP concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 microM and in the P48 fraction at 8 and 16 microM cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP-PDE kinetic plots according to Lineweaver-Burk for the calculation of Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax) were nonlinear, indicating both a low and high enzyme form. The Michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high Km form of cyclic AMP-PDE in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low Km form of the P5 particulate fraction. The Vmax of the high Km form of the P48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control. Phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals. These changes in specific activity, Michaelis constants, and Vmax of cyclic AMP-PDE from crude homogenates of isolated fat cells from exercise trained animals may account for the decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP following catecholamine stimulation of isolated fat cells from trained rats. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract contains several quantitative values and measurements, including the specific activity of cyclic AMP-PDE at different concentrations of cyclic AMP, Michaelis constants (Km), maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax), and phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines.

It is literally his babysitter.  I waited a long time to do anything about it but it has just gotten worse.  I wanted to avoid the argument.  I want to see him on his birthday.  But I have finally had enough.  He woke up from a nap the other day and immediately picked up her phone.  I said it was enough and took it away.  Que the screaming tantrum.  She said \\"just give it to him I have a headache and I have homework\\".  I put my foot down and said he needs social interaction and exercise.  She comes back with \\"he gets both of those at school. He is student of the month, has the highest grades in his class, and if he wants YouTube he can have it, besides, I limit him to 3 hours a day\\".  I was at a loss for words.  Three.  Fucking.  Hours.  Around this time her father walks in and wants to know why my son is freaking out and we're arguing.  I explained that I took the phone away and why and he actually agreed with me.  He even admitted that he was guilty of it, too.  I stole a glance at his mother and she was giving me the shittiest death glare I've ever seen.  Now she's punishing her father by limiting his time with my son and she's been speaking to him like he's retarded.  He and I both know why.  So now my son gets out of school at 3pm.  Watches YouTube for an hour or two, takes a nap, does it again, then goes to bed.  Once in a while he'll play with toys or ask to go to the playground.  I have started taking the phone away.  Every single time he kicks and screams and throws himself on the ground.  He's even said \\"daddy isn't my friend anymore\\" which I laughed about and said I love you anyway but honestly it fucking hurt.  \\n\\nSo now I'm back in the doghouse, the father is suffering for it, and my son doesn't even like spending time with me.  \\n\\nShould I just let him enjoy his cartoons?

While the Depression had several causes, one most relevant to Minnesota was that United States businesses in the 1920s had improved their efficiency through standardizing production methods and eliminating waste.  Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of organized labor, nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.  Instead, the windfall went to stockholders.  The eventual result was that consumers could no longer afford the goods that factories were producing.Floyd B.

As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\".\\n\\nPovenmire later became a director on Family Guy, starting with the season two episode, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\".

Do whatever you want.

Creator MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded \\"That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No!

The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- atom\\n\\n- molecules\\n\\n- protons\\n\\n- nucleus\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"nucleus","rationale":"The correct answer is: nucleus."},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.\\nContext: SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea.\\nKim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.\\nIt calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action.

Like with arginine alpha-ketoglutarate, the popular nitric oxide booster, this form of creatine is supposed to be better absorbed by the body than monohydrate. Most studies use a high-dose loading strategy, which can rapidly elevate your muscle creatine content. Although this is not necessary, it will help you reap the benefits of creatine after just a few days . To load with creatine, take four 5-gram servings throughout the day for about 5-7 days. After that, take 3-5 grams per day to maintain your muscle creatine stores . The key point to take away from this article is that creatine supplementation can certainly enhance performance output, especially anaerobically, and it does this through a variety of mechanisms (one of which appears to be by enhancing recovery during intermittent, high-intensity exercise). Creatine works. Weight lifters know this, professors know this, the marketers who sell the stuff know this. But nobody should put anything in their body without weighing the benefits and risks first. That goes for everything from beer to marshmallows to the amazing amino acid called creatine. It’s not anything scary. Some research shows that taking 20 grams of creatine daily for 5 days followed by 5 grams daily for 5 days does not improve muscle strength. But other research shows that taking 20 grams daily for 4-10 days does improve strength. Research on creatine in the elderly is also conflicting. Over the last couple of decades, creatine has become a supplement staple for guys looking to build strength and lean muscle mass. At the very least, you've probably seen guys around the gym taking creatine in the form of powder, capsules, or as part of a pre-made shake. “[But] the best effect in healthy humans is seen when creatine is combined with resistance exercise training.” Creatine causes gastrointestinal upset.

Over 80,000 different chemicals are used in industries world wide. Around the world hundreds of millions of tons of harmful waste are produced each year. Often, it is difficult and expensive to get rid of these chemicals or to store them in a way that does not endanger human life and the environment.\\n     Every year, major health problems result from harmful waste. Sadly, it is often when someone has died or, become seriously ill that governments will take action and reduce levels of dumped harmful waste.

As part-time music minister of the church, Greg Tenorly sat in his usual place on the podium, behind and slightly to the left of the pastor. He wondered why attendance was up. It was a perfect day--seventy degrees, sunny. That had to be part of the reason. And the sermon title was 'Forgiveness Fighters.' People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage.\\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother?\\nMaybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened.

Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics. But in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in the Republican Party, the state, and cities where they had significant population was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation.

Recent progress in few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation where examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate these methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted to this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples. We also propose a new split of ImageNet, consisting of a large set of classes, with a hierarchical structure. Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would.","target":"We propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes","rationale":"Here's a summary:\\\\nWe propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes."},{"source":"The mine would operate nonstop seven days a week and use tons of cyanide each day to leach the gold from crushed ore.\\n\\nBased on that paragraph can we conclude that the sentence below is true?\\nA weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock.\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The paragraph states that the mine will use tons of cyanide each day.

A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\\\\n\\\\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\\\\n\\\\nHow is vasectomy done?\\\\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\\\\n\\\\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \\\\n\\\\nPage 2 of this Article \\\\nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\\\\nThe Doctor's Response\\\\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period.

Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

Passage:After Louis XIV's marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain on 9 June 1660, Queen Anne turned her attention to the marriage of Philippe. He had previously been encouraged to court his older cousin the Duchess of Montpensier, eldest daughter of Gaston and his first wife Marie de Bourbon. Known as Mademoiselle at this time, she had an immense private fortune and had previously rejected suitors such as Charles II of England. Born in 1627, she was the sole heiress of her mother who died in childbirth. Mademoiselle declined the union, complaining that Philippe always stayed near his mother as if he was \\"like a child\\". Mademoiselle instead remained unmarried. Philippe would marry instead another first cousin, Princess Henrietta of England, youngest child of King Charles I of England and his wife Queen Henrietta Maria, who was Philippe's aunt and had taken refuge at the court of France after the birth of Princess Henrietta in 1644. They lived at the Palais Royal and at the Palais du Louvre. In 1660, after the restoration of the House of Stuart to the throne of England under her brother Charles II, Princess Henrietta returned to England to visit her sister, the Princess of Orange, who later caught smallpox and died. The French court officially asked for Henrietta's hand on behalf of Philippe on 22 November 1660 while she was in England. The couple signed their marriage contract at the Palais Royal on 30 March 1661. The ceremony took place the next day in the same building in front of select members of the court. The dowry promised was a huge 840,000 livres. Known as Henriette d'Angleterre in France, and Minette to her intimates, she was known officially as Madame and was ever popular with the court. Court gossip later said that the king was the father of Henrietta's first child.

A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click.

All three of these nucleic acids work together to produce a protein. The mRNA takes the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located. Ribosomes are the organelles where the proteins are made. The ribosomes themselves are made out of rRNA and other proteins. The mRNA binds to the ribosome, bringing the genetic instructions to order the amino acids to the site of protein synthesis. Finally, the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome ( Figure below and Figure below ). In mRNA, the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and U) are arranged into codons of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except for the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis. tRNA, which has a specific “3-leaf clover structure,” contains a three base region called the anticodon , which can base pair to the corresponding three-base codon region on mRNA. More will be discussed on these processes in the Protein Synthesis: The Genetic Code (Advanced) and Protein Synthesis: Translation (Advanced) concepts.\\n\\n\\nQ: What are the three types of rna involved in protein synthesis?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- messenger, organic and transfer\\n\\n- messenger, transfer, and organic\\n\\n- organic , transfer , and ribosomal\\n\\n- messenger, transfer, and ribosomal\\n\\nA:","target":"messenger, transfer, and ribosomal","rationale":"This question asks about the three types of RNA involved in protein synthesis.

The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.\\n\\n- Chrétien de Troyes (\\"Christian\\") was a late-12th-century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated).\\n\\n- Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.\\n\\n- A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz.\\n\\n- Old Occitan (Modern Occitan: \\"occitan ancian\\"), also called Old Provençal, was the earliest form of the Occitano-Romance languages, as attested in writings dating from the eighth through the fourteenth centuries. Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan. As the term \\"occitanus\\" appeared around the year 1300, Old Occitan is referred to as \\"Romance\\" (Occitan: \\"romans\\") or \\"Provençal\\" (Occitan: \\"proensals\\") in medieval texts.\\n\\n- Theobald I ( French : Thibaut , Spanish : Teobaldo , often referred to as Thibaut de Navarre and Thibaut de Champagne ) ( 30 May 1201 -- 8 July 1253 ) , also called the Troubadour and the Posthumous , was Count of Champagne ( as Theobald IV ) from birth and King of Navarre from 1234 . He was famous as a trouvère and Crusader , and was the first Frenchman to rule Navarre .\\n\\n- Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre.

The demonstrations aimed to \\"\\"expose Wal-Mart’s shameful labor practices and support workers,\\"\\" according to One Wisconsin Now, which then made this claim: \\"\\"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined.\\"\\" That reminded us of a March 2011 claim by filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. He said in a Madison speech that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a \\"\\"defining challenge of our time.\\"\\" The pope said that while the earnings of a minority \\"\\"are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.\\"\\" Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly  a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let’s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they’re not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person’s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group’s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families. Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims. But let's keep shopping around a little. Similar claim It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sanders said the Walton family owns \\"\\"more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America,\\"\\" a claim PolitiFact National rated . Our colleagues found that Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012. Allegretto found that the Waltons’ wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families. The 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population. But we found, using the Forbes 400 list for 2013, that the wealth of six of Sam Walton’s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth: No. 6 Christy Walton (daughter-in-law), $35.4 billion No. 7: Jim Walton (son), $33.8 billion No. 8: Alice Walton (daughter), $33.5 billion No. 9: S. Robson Walton (son), $33.3 billion No. 95: Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $4.7 billion No. 110: Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4 billion Total Walton family wealth: $144.7 billion. A note before we close: Allegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown.

Much to my husbands dismay, we don't have enough saved for the snowblower he wants, so we're stuck with shoveling it ourselves (sidenote: in case it gets brought up, no I will not pay for snow-removal service when both of us are strong, able-bodied adults who have the time). I work nights, 10 hour shifts, and he works days, 8 hour shifts. Both of our jobs are physically demanding. So far we've been good about doing our fair share of winter maintenance. \\n\\n\\nSituation: I am working 12 hour shifts most of the week due to a surge in production (yay overtime pay). Due to incoming weather, his job notified employees yesterday afternoon that today they would start an hour late. The snow started falling at 11pm and hasn't stopped. I got off after 830 am this morning ready to take a shower and do some shoveling, if needed. Turns out it was very much needed as my husband didn't shovel any of the driveway (1 car length by 3 car widths of pavement), the back sidewalk (idk, 25? feet) or the front steps and sidewalk ( about 30? feet total). It's been snowing for 9ish hours so it's not a small amount, it's several inches deep. \\n\\n\\nI shovel the driveway and the back sidewalk. I start the front sidewalk but I stop because I'm upset and think it's unfair. So I text him, stating clearly why I'm kinda pissed and that the front sidewalk will be waiting for him to shovel when he gets home. I also say that \\"I don't love him any less, that I'm just upset.\\" I don't want him thinking I hate him, I'm just upset at the situation. No response yet but I dont expect one until he goes to lunch. I suspect he used the extra hour this morning to sleep in, which he has every right to do. However maybe a text about how he didn't get to the shoveling would have been appreciated, that way I wouldn't have been blindsided. \\n\\n\\nI've been going back and forth over if I should feel this way. Half of me is saying \\"Suck it up, Buttercup, that's life,\\" while the other half says I need to make my feelings known so I don't push it down and allow it to fester and manifest in some other way. So, fair Reddit, AITA for assuming my husband would do some shoveling before he went to work and not leave me with it all?\\n\\n\\nP.S.

This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month.

Over 10 weeks, they alternated each week between images of eyes and pictures of flowers.\\nDr. Bateson, a behavioral biologist and leader of the study, said that even though the eyes were not real they still seemed to make people behave more honestly. They effect may arise from behavioral characteristics that developed as early humans formed social groups that increased their chances of survival. Individuals had to co-operate for the good of the group, rather than act selfishly.\\n\\"If nobody is watching us, it is in our interests to behave selfishly.

Measuring 15 meters across when fully inflated, each balloon carries a payload of electronics including a flight computer, altitude control system, communications antenna and a solar power station -- turning the craft into a self-powering cell tower in the sky.\\n@highlight\\nGoogle plans to use a network of high-flying balloons to deliver low-cost Internet\\n@highlight\\nProject Loon will give access to remote and under served places around world\\n@highlight\\nLoon balloons strategically positioned on stratospheric winds, controlled by algorithms\\n@highlight\\nGoogle: Project can play critical role during a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis\\nThe need for the connectivity that @placeholder promises is immense.\\n\\nPick one option, \\"@placeholder\\" refers to:\\n- CNN\\n- Chinese\\n- Google\\n- Hong Kong\\n- Pixar\\n- Project Loon\\n- The Red Balloon\\n- Up\\n- Zhuge Liang","target":"Project Loon","rationale":"In the given context, @placeholder contains promises for low-cost internet access.

The Giants were able to hold the Bucs to six three and outs in their first seven possessions.  On offense, Eli Manning and Tiki Barber were effective if not spectacular.  Near the end of the first quarter, the Giants started a 54-yard drive, culminating on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Plaxico Burress. Midway through the second quarter, the defense struck again as Cadillac Williams fumbled a pitch and tackle Fred Robbins recovered for New York at the Bucs' 28.  The Giants then used a deep pass to Burress and hard-nosed running to extend their lead to 14-0.  The touchdown was scored on a one yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs.  Tampa Bay had chances to get back into the game over the next 20 minutes, but several dropped passes and questionable fourth down plays doomed them.  Overall, rookie quarterback Bruce Gradkowski played well for Tampa Bay, but it wasn't enough.  The Giants clinched the win late in the fourth quarter with some power running from Jacobs and Barber.  Jay Feely added a 31-yard field goal to provide the final points in the 17-3 win. Rookie defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka had his first ever sack and six tackles, middle linebacker Reggie Torbor added a sack, and Fred Robbins continued his fine season with the fumble recovery.  On offense, Barber and Jacobs rushed for over 100 yards combined, Burress notched seven receptions,  and Manning completed 16 of 31 passes for 154 yards and the touchdown to Burress.  The key was his ability to avoid the mistakes in the blustery conditions. Note: The two offensive touchdowns scored by the Giants in this game were the first two offensive touchdowns scored against the Bucs since Tiki and Ronde Barber met for the first time during the 1997 season.\\n\\nHow many passes did Eli Manning throw?","target":"31","rationale":"Manning completed 16 of 31 passes for 154 yards and the touchdown to Burress.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England.

She is best known for her 1977 hit, \\"You Light Up My Life\\", which spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year. Boone later focused her music career on country music resulting in the 1980 No. 1 country hit \\"Are You on the Road to Lovin' Me Again\\". In the 1980s, she recorded Christian music which garnered her four top 10 Contemporary Christian albums as well as two more Grammys.\\n\\nDuring 1981-82, Boone toured the United States in a production of the stage adaptation of the film Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The play was a commercial and critical success nationwide before opening on Broadway in July 1982. The Broadway reviews were lackluster, but a scathing review by The New York Times led the show to close after just five performances. The day after the show's closing, several of the show's stars and theatergoers protested the closing outside the New York Times' building, hoping for a retraction of its review and the re-opening of the show. But, despite the enthusiastic reception of the show from Broadway theatergoers, the producers believed that the show could not overcome its reviews and the show remained closed.  Boone continued her theater work, appearing periodically in stage productions nationwide including lead roles in Camelot, Meet Me in St. Louis, Mississippi Love, South Pacific, The Human Comedy, and The King and I. Boone returned twice to the New York stage. She starred as Maria in the 1990 Lincoln Center production of The Sound of Music, which was nominated as Outstanding Musical Revival by the Drama Desk Awards. In 1996, Boone played against her image as Rizzo in the 1990s revival of Grease.  In 1978, Boone made her first foray into television with a musical adaptation of O. Henry's The Gift of the Magi co-starring John Rubinstein. She also headlined two of her own NBC television music specials - The Same Old Brand New Me (1980) and One Step Closer (1982). In 1984, Boone appeared in the television movie Sins of the Past co-starring Anthony Geary, Barbara Carrera and Kim Cattrall. In the film, Boone portrayed Clarissa Hope, a young prostitute who leaves her job after a fellow prostitute is murdered, and subsequently reforms herself as a Christian music singer. The film was a Top 10 Nielsen hit. Boone has since made guest appearances on several television shows including Step by Step and Baywatch Nights and was featured in the television films Come on, Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story and Treehouse Hostage.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Debby Boone","rationale":"Debby Boone is the main topic of this text.

This may have resulted from Alfred Burges's engineering firm, Walker, Burges and Cooper, having undertaken work on the East Bute Docks in Cardiff for the second Marquess. The 3rd Marquess became Burges's greatest architectural patron; both were men of their times; both had fathers whose industrial endeavours provided the means for their sons' architectural achievements, and both sought to \\"redeem the evils of industrialism by re-living the art of the Middle Ages\\".On his succession to the Marquessate at the age of one, Bute inherited an income of £300,000 a year, and, by the time he met Burges, he was considered the richest man in Britain, if not the world. Bute's wealth was important to the success of the partnership: as Burges himself wrote, \\"Good art is far too rare and far too precious ever to be cheap.\\" But, as a scholar, antiquarian, compulsive builder and enthusiastic medievalist, Bute brought more than money to the relationship and his resources and his interests allied with Burges's genius to create what McLees considers to be \\"Bute's most memorable overall achievement.\\"\\nHowever occasioned, the connection lasted the rest of Burges's life and led to his most important works. To the Marquess and his wife, Burges was the \\"soul-inspiring one\\". The architectural writer Michael Hall considers Burges's rebuilding of Cardiff Castle and the complete reconstruction of the ruin of Castell Coch, north of the city, as representing his highest achievements.

POST : I (26F) had shoulder surgery in December and have finally gotten the ok from my surgeon to resume normal activity. For the past three months I have not been allowed to run, use stationary bikes, ellipticals or lift more than 2-5 lbs. The recovery has been incredibly painful-- possibly the most painful thing I've ever had to work through. The whole thing has massively lowered my self-esteem. I used to be fit and happy with my body. Now, I'm several lbs heavier and just really frustrated with not being able to workout.\\n\\nIt's coming up on the one year mark since I injured my arm and all I want is to feel like I have some control over my body again. I decided that I wanted to try personal training so I can have someone there to check my form and help me find creative ways to push myself around my limitations. I feel like getting someone qualified to guide me is the safest way to get back in shape without compromising my shoulder's recovery.\\n\\nMy friend, Julie, goes to a gym she LOVES that is really close to my house. She's been going there for over a year. After texting her a question about the gym rates, she called to tell me she didn't think it'd be a good fit for me. She started out by telling me it was SUPER expensive and that it’s got limited equipment (it has great equipment), but eventually she just came out and said \\"I don't want to be a bitch, but I just don't want to see you there.\\" It’s a small facility and she feels like she's finally comfortable working out. She's struggled to be active her whole life and to find a place that really worked for her and this was it. It's clearly become her fitness safe space--and I get that. But then she got super condescending and wouldn't listen to me when I told her I didn't want to workout together, I just noticed their trainers had great accreditations. I tried to explain how hard  the past few months with my shoulder have been and that I really needed to find a trainer who knew what they were doing. She pretty much just ignored me and told me to try LA Fitness or anywhere else.\\n\\nIts been a week and I finally had time to go through and contact 16 different gyms in my area. Julie's gym is tied for the cheapest prices with one other facility. (Depending on the number of sessions I purchased, hers would be the cheaper of the two by $5/session). I texted her to let her know this -- including the names of all the facilities I contacted to show I made an effort (I also made a list of all the prices), but I haven't set up meetings to go talk to trainers at either gym yet (I intend to speak to both). She has yet to text me back and I have a feeling that she's pissed. I kind of wish that there were more options available, but I'm also a broke student and unfortunately her gym actually is really fairly priced with supposedly excellent coaches.\\n\\nAITA if I decide to set up personal training sessions at her gym after she told me she wasn't okay with it?","target":"no","rationale":"In the post, the author uses the past tense to describe the events, which suggests that this event has already occurred.\\\\nBased on the above analysis, it seems that the post is not hypothetical, as the author describes events that have already occurred.

[3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown. The [14C]glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical values and measurements (for example, \\"10 g/kg\\", \\"approximately 10\\", etc.) that are important for the study.

Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.

However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup.

The total amount of thermal energy for every particle must be at least as high as what is needed to boil water. Therefore, we can infer that the higher mass means there are many more moving particles giving pot B greater total kinetic energy. This makes sense since boiling requires adding enough heat so all the molecules reach their boiling point temperature simultaneously, which occurs when they have sufficient thermal/kinetic energies to escape into vapor phase.

To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.\\n\\nWould case A show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case B?\\n\\nHint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...","target":"more","rationale":"In the question, David is an entomologist who has been studying ants and other ant-like creatures (hymenopterans).\\nBased on his observations of two distinct trails made by these insects, we can assume that pheromones were involved in some way.

It is not known whether human plaques take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo. In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing atheromatous plaques were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 degrees C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human atheromatous plaques should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acoustic Impedance Tests 2)Animal 3)Cats","target":"No","rationale":"The given abstract describes the results of an experiment that investigated the uptake of hematoporphyrin derivative by atheromatous plaques in five human patients and 16 rabbits.

She had three older sisters, Ethel, Rose, and Reine. An older brother, Charles, drowned at the age of 15 in 1906.\\n\\nSince the early 1920s, there has been speculation that Davies and Hearst had a child together some time between 1920 and 1923. The child was rumored to be Patricia Lake (nee Van Cleve), who was publicly identified as Davies' niece. On October 3, 1993, Lake died of complications from lung cancer in Indian Wells, California. Ten hours before her death, Lake requested that her son publicly announce that she was not Davies' niece but Davies' biological daughter, whom she had conceived with Hearst. Lake had never commented on her alleged paternity in public, even after Hearst's and Davies' deaths, but did tell her grown children and friends. Lake's claim was published in her death notice, which was published in newspapers.  Lake told her friends and family that Davies became pregnant by Hearst in the early 1920s. As the child was conceived during Hearst's extra-marital affair with Davies and out of wedlock, Hearst sent Davies to Europe to have the child in secret to avoid a public scandal. Hearst later joined Davies in Europe. Lake claimed she was born in a Catholic hospital outside of Paris between 1920 and 1923 (she was unsure of the precise date). Lake was then given to Davies' sister Rose, whose own child had died in infancy, and passed off as Rose and her husband George Van Cleve's daughter. Lake stated that Hearst paid for her schooling and both Davies and Hearst spent considerable time with her. Davies reportedly told Lake of her true parentage when she was 11 years old. Lake said Hearst confirmed that he was her father on her wedding day at age 17 where both Davies and Hearst gave her away.

Last week, we were talking and he expressed he is insecure about my ex, specifically because it was a \\"first love\\" type thing. I have reassured him there is literally nothing going on and I am not interested in my ex romantically at all anymore (all true!!). Any romantic feelings feel so far back in the past. I am way over it and 100% into my current bf. He trusts my reassurances and is also friends with an ex, so he somewhat understands.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe Issue:\\n\\nToday, I was scrolling through my phone and my boyfriend saw 2 things that upset him:\\n\\n1) While my current boyfriend and I were in the hooking up/not sure what we are stage, ex and I had a life update chat with my ex on facebook messenger in which I told him \\"I miss you (definitely not in the same way I did before) ! Hope you are well, hope to see you soon!\\"\\n\\n2) A few months ago (after my boyfriend and I started dating), my ex was in town and asked to hang out. I couldn't make it at the time but offered to facetime to catch up.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHis point of view:\\n\\n1. He is worried that I was still into my ex (by saying I miss you) at the time we had already started hooking up.\\n2. He is very upset that I have never mentioned that I facetime my ex occasionally, and that when my boyfriend and I saw each other/texted (don't remember which it was) that day I didn't mention it happening. He thinks it is disrespectful and that I meant to lie by omission.\\n\\nMy point of view:\\n\\n1. The I miss you was completely platonic on my end. It happened a few months after we had that good closure conversation and I wanted to express good will and friendship. I was hanging out with an old college friend at the time so naturally I thought of him and missed that he wasn't there too. IN A FRIENDLY WAY, which I tried to express! And current boyfriend and I were not yet serious, so it reflects nothing on our relationship, in my opinion.\\n2. The idea that talking to my ex would be disrespectful to my current boyfriend honestly did not cross my mind :( , as I do call my other college friends sometimes and never mention it either. Not on purpose! Had it come up, I would NEVER lie about anything, it just wasn't thought of. It also was a quick call for mayyybe at most an hour and we haven't hung out in person nor been romantic/sexual at ALL after our break up. Also at the time, my boyfriend and I had only been official for about 2 months and I had ZERO idea he was so insecure over my ex. So, it was literally a non-issue to me at the time, and to specifically bring it up would make it sound like I thought it was a bigger deal than it really was. I think it would have been weird to bring it up with no prompting or any reason to. \\n\\nSo am I in the wrong? Please let me know if anything I did was me being the asshole! I just seriously can't tell what would have been the right choice of action each time these things happened in the past, and I want to be better in the future.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;","target":"no","rationale":"The author has been dating their current boyfriend for almost a year, and they have had no contact with their ex from college for over two years.

Carson wants to protect himself from this noise, but he also needs to be able to hear the orders given to him by his boss on the site.\\n\\nWould electronic ear protectors reduce or increase the amplitude of the jackhammer?\\n\\nHint: Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.","target":"reduce","rationale":"Electronic ear protectors work differently.

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.

I pointed this out to my wife after dinner Saturday about the cult like worship and her response was. \\" I mean it is freakishly huge *laughs*\\"\\n\\nMy problem with a lot of this is more complex than the way that everyone seems to obsessively talk about this guys hog. Some of it stems from the fact that my wife had a \\"FWB\\" relationship with him for a few years. ( 10 years ago, long before I ever met her) A lot of it I feel comes from the fact that everyone is comfortable OPENLY discussing this man's sex life.\\nMaybe this is where I start to sound prude or like a baby but I don't openly discuss the kinds of kink my wife and I are into. I feel like everyone just being so nonchalant about discussing the first time they saw Jeff naked or the first time they saw Jeff fucking some random chick at a party is just.... too much\\n\\nThe whole thing just feels weird to me, with all of the different factors adding up, sometimes it just makes me reluctant to even agree to go out to dinner because at the end of the night regardless of where we go or what we do at some point this subject is going to be brought up and yet again I'm going to be forced to either confront the idea that my wife had sex with this guy for years or ignore it.\\n\\nI have tried to talk to my wife about it but at the end of the day, if the tables got turned I don't see any of it happening much less being so accepted. I would be mortified and embarrassed to sit across the table from an ex girlfriend as everyone else traded stories about having/seeing her having sex.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nAITA for slowly over time wanting to exclude myself from group plans with my wife and her circle because of the constant inappropriate joking subject matter about her ex-bf/fwb's massive endowment","target":"yes","rationale":"The author is upset that their wife's friends make jokes about her ex-boyfriend's large penis, and he feels that his own sexual practices with his wife would be unacceptable if discussed in the same way.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods.\\nCombining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.\\nTeasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken.\\nSalt promotes over-eating\\nEleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.\\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\\nThe writer believes that:","target":"Salt promotes over-eating","rationale":"The last paragraph states that “11 percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt.” The conclusion is based on a study conducted by sensory researchers from Deakin University, which suggests that there is some truth to this claim and it has been backed up with evidence provided within the context.

Yet language generated by RNNs often shows several degenerate characteristics that are uncommon in human language; while fluent, RNN language production can be overly generic, repetitive, and even self-contradictory.   We postulate that the objective function optimized by RNN language models, which amounts to the overall perplexity of a text, is not expressive enough to capture the abstract qualities of good generation such as Grice’s Maxims. In this paper, we introduce a general learning framework that can construct a decoding objective better suited for generation. Starting with a generatively trained RNN language model, our framework learns to construct a substantially stronger generator by combining several discriminatively trained models that can collectively address the limitations of RNN generation.   Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by the resulting generator is preferred over  that  of  baselines  by  a  large  margin  and  significantly  enhances  the  overall coherence, style, and information content of the generated text.","target":"We build a stronger natural language generator by discriminatively training scoring functions that rank candidate generations with respect to various qualities of good writing","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe build a stronger natural language generator by discriminatively training scoring functions that rank candidate generations with respect to various qualities of good writing."},{"source":"Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

A question we ask is whether one can leverage abundant unlabeled texts to improve syntactic parsers, beyond just using the texts to obtain more generalisable lexical features (i.e. beyond word embeddings). To this end, we propose a novel latent-variable generative model for semi-supervised syntactic dependency parsing. As exact inference is intractable, we introduce a differentiable relaxation to obtain approximate samples and compute gradients with respect to the parser parameters. Our method (Differentiable Perturb-and-Parse) relies on differentiable dynamic programming over stochastically perturbed edge scores.

As a quintessential San Francisco property, there is much to this property as well as nearby.We stayed in room 590, the Dunkirk suite. It is a corner accomodation with great city views. It is well appointed in the classic sense; elegant Napoleonic decor along with modern touches like large flatscreens and two full baths. Along with numerous lounges and restaurants, I would recommend the Tonga Room. It is a Polynesian themed lounge and restaurant replete with thatched roofs, tiki iodols and rain falling from the ceiling accompanied by thunder from the loudspeaker. A true nostalgic experience!This hotel is ideally situated at the intersection of two cable car lines, and walking distance to Chinatown. It boasts an enviable location atop Nob Hill, and the service aspect from the staff is one of total service.This hotel is ideal for couples or families on a holiday, all the way to conventions. As it is a classic hotel, it will not have all the wired amenities of newer properties like a W Hotel, and Nob Hill is a bit far from the airport or Silicon Valley.

We interpret the model through average visualizations of this reduced set of features.

According to Robert Service, in 1921 Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union, included Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and Karabakh under Azerbaijani control to try to placate Turkey to join the Soviet Union. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would probably have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established with the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on July 7, 1923. According to Karl R. DeRouen it was created as an enclave so that a narrow strip of land would separate it from Armenia proper. According to Audrey L.

Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names.\\n\\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.  Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.  Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.  In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.\\n\\nWhat is techniques?","target":"means to better mix and blend recorded music.","rationale":"From the given context, we see that various techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. \\n\\nTherefore, from the context it can be inferred that: \\"techniques\\" refers to methods used by DJs to improve their skills at mixing and blending of different sounds or records while performing in front of an audience."},{"source":"In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Christmas is approaching and he decides to follow his neighbors' example of decorating his lawn with a few holiday items. Upon receiving a social security check in the mail, he promptly tears it in half and calls the pension office to speak to his case worker, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). She tells him that he will be sent another check but it's clearly evident that Frank simply calls in to be able to speak with her. They get along and chat about mundane things including which books she's reading and how many leaves are growing on Frank's avocado seed. One day, Frank plucks up the courage to say that he'll be in Kansas City the following week, where she lives, and would like to meet her and take her out to dinner. Though nervous about meeting him face to face, Sarah agrees, becoming excited.In the middle of the night, Frank wakes up, dons his robe, and wanders sleepily downstairs.

The left-footed Don Alfredo was the head of the team. Pfaff was a true playmaker with exceptionally good ball control and great skills at free kicks.

In 1954, Atlético Madrid offered him 180,000 D-Mark but his wife Edith was against a move to Spain. Possibly Pfaff's greatest game was the 6–1 against Rangers F.C. in the 1959–60 semifinal first leg of the European Champion Clubs' Cup, which was followed by a 6–3 win of Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow in the second leg.

Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.

Consisting of two penannular bracelets, an armlet and a chain of six spiral wire rings, it is now preserved at the British Museum. The town was founded in 25 BC, with the name of Emerita Augusta (meaning the veterans – discharged soldiers – of the army of Augustus, who founded the city; the name Mérida is an evolution of this) by order of Emperor Augustus, to protect a pass and a bridge over the Guadiana river. Emerita Augusta was one of the ends of the Vía de la Plata (Silver Way), a strategic Roman Route between the gold mines around Asturica Augusta and the most important Roman city in the Iberian Peninsula. The city became the capital of Lusitania province, and one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire. Mérida preserves more important ancient Roman monuments than any other city in Spain, including a triumphal arch and a theatre.\\n Passage 2:In addition to Shahrbanu, the historian Al-Masudi provides the names of four other children of Yazdegerd III; two sons, namely Peroz and Bahram, and two daughters, Adrag and Mardawand.

One allegedly married Abdullah, son of the Caliph Umar, and became the mother of his son Salim, while another married Muhammad, son of the Caliph Abu Bakr, and became the mother of his son Qasim.

A few months after completing infantry basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he was sent to West Germany.\\n\\nAfter his release from prison in September 1961, Carter became a professional boxer. At 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m), Carter was shorter than the average middleweight, but he fought all of his professional career at 155-160 lb (70-72.6 kg). His aggressive style and punching power (resulting in many early-round knockouts) drew attention, establishing him as a crowd favorite and earning him the nickname \\"Hurricane.\\" After he defeated a number of middleweight contenders--such as Florentino Fernandez, Holley Mims, Gomeo Brennan, and George Benton--the boxing world took notice. The Ring first listed him as one of its \\"Top 10\\" middleweight contenders in July 1963. At the end of 1965, they ranked him as the number five middleweight.  He fought six times in 1963, winning four bouts and losing two. He remained ranked in the lower part of the top 10 until December 20, when he surprised the boxing world by flooring past and future world champion Emile Griffith twice in the first round and scoring a technical knockout. That win resulted in The Ring's ranking of Carter as the number three contender for Joey Giardello's world middleweight title. Carter won two more fights (one a decision over future heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis) in 1964, before meeting Giardello in Philadelphia for a 15-round championship match on December 14. Carter landed a few solid rights to the head and staggered Giardello in the fourth, but was unable to follow them up, and Giardello took control of the fight in the fifth round. The judges awarded Giardello a unanimous decision.  After that fight, Carter's ranking in The Ring began to decline. He fought nine times in 1965, winning five but losing three of four against contenders Luis Manuel Rodriguez, Dick Tiger, and Harry Scott. Tiger, in particular, floored Carter three times in their match. \\"It was,\\" Carter said, \\"the worst beating that I took in my life--inside or outside the ring.\\" During his visit to London (to fight Scott) Carter was involved in an incident in which a shot was fired in his hotel room.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis.

Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.\\n\\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\"\\nProf Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.\\nThe difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.\\n\\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\"\\nProf Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn.

The need for a unique ssDNA binding function in response to severe damage, suggests a distinct role for DdrB which may encompass not only standard SSB protein function in protection of ssDNA, but also more specialized roles in protein recruitment or DNA architecture maintenance.

The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826.

Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives.\\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\\nHow do people generally feel about Emily Nagoski's book Come as You are?\\n\\nA. people aren't generally interested in the book\\n\\nB. people are indifferent to the book\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. people are eager to get their mitts on the book","target":"D","rationale":"The question asks how people generally feel about Nagoski's book.

His mother, Joanne (McKay), was an American professional figure skater and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers: Bobby Jr., Blake and Bart, and a younger sister: Michelle.\\n\\nAs a dual Canadian and American citizen, Hull was eligible to play for either country internationally. While playing at UMD, he was passed over by officials with Team Canada when they selected their roster for the 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships. However, the American national team invited him to join their squad. Hull accepted and led the team in scoring with 7 goals and 11 points for the sixth place Americans. Hull later said the faith shown in him by American officials gave him the confidence to excel in his career. He played with Team USA for the rest of his career, and at the 1986 Calgary Cup tournament, played a pivotal role in a 5-3 upset of Canada by the Americans. Following the game, he said \\"I don't feel more like an American than a Canadian. I just want to play.\\"  Hull tied Mike Modano for the American scoring lead at the 1991 Canada Cup with nine points. He led the Americans into the tournament final against Canada, but was held pointless in the decisive game as Canada won the tournament with a 4-2 game. Canadian fans turned on Hull at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996. In the semifinal against Russia, fans in Ottawa loudly booed Hull and chanted \\"traitor\\" towards him as he scored two goals to lead the United States to the final against Canada. In the deciding game of the best-of-three final, Hull scored a key goal as the Americans turned a 2-1 deficit with five minutes to play into a 5-2 victory and captured the championship. Hull led all players with 11 points and was a tournament all-star at forward.  Making his Olympic debut at the 1998 Winter Games, Hull scored two goals in four games. The Americans were quickly eliminated from the tournament and were criticized for their lack of desire and leadership. The team was further embarrassed when it was discovered some members had trashed their hotel room following their elimination. Hull was initially blamed as being a culprit. He angrily denied the accusation and claimed it was an invention of Canadian media upset that he was playing for the United States. Hull, Modano and John LeClair formed the American's top line for the 2002 Olympics. The trio were dominant throughout most of the tournament, leading Team USA to the gold medal game against Canada. Hull and LeClair finished second and third in overall scoring, respectively; however they were held pointless against Team Canada in the final. Hull and the Americans settled for the silver medal following a 5-2 defeat.  Team USA named Hull an alternate captain of its veteran-laden team for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

In 1724, Asif Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad.

It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.\\n\\n- Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.\\n\\n- Morgan State University (commonly referred to as MSU, Morgan State, or Morgan) is a public research university and historically black college (HBCU) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a pn junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other semiconductors such as selenium or germanium are sometimes used.\\n\\n- Julius H.

They are of high electrical resistance   higher than typical resistance materials, but still of much lower resistance than insulators. Their resistance decreases as their temperature increases, which is behavior opposite to that of a metal. Finally, their conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by the deliberate, controlled introduction of impurities (\\"doping\\") into the crystal structure, which lowers its resistance but also permits the creation of semiconductor junctions between differently-doped regions of the extrinsic semiconductor crystal. The behavior of charge carriers which include electrons, ions and electron holes at these junctions is the basis of diodes, transistors and all modern electronics.\\n\\n- The carbon group is a periodic table group consisting of carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), and flerovium (Fl).\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\\n\\n- The Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) is an American non-profit organization that supports and represents nearly 300,000 students attending its 47 member-schools that include public historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), medical schools, and law schools.

The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.\\nIn the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\\nThor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.\\nLoki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep \\"Odinsleep\\" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifr st the means of traveling between worlds to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.\\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\\nIn a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power.

Passage:Hurling is administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is played throughout the world, and is popular among members of the Irish diaspora in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and South Korea. In many parts of Ireland, however, hurling is a fixture of life. It has featured regularly in art forms such as film, music and literature. The final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was listed in second place by CNN in its \\"10 sporting events you have to see live\\", after the Olympic Games and ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship. After covering the 1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final between Kilkenny and Waterford for BBC Television, English commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme was moved to describe hurling as his second favourite sport in the world after his first love, football. Alex Ferguson used footage of an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final in an attempt to motivate his players during his time as manager of Premier League soccer outfit Manchester United; the players winced at the standard of physicality and intensity in which the hurlers were engaged. In 2007, Forbes magazine described the media attention and population multiplication of Thurles town ahead of one of the game's annual provincial hurling finals as being \\"the rough equivalent of 30 million Americans watching a regional lacrosse game\\".\\n Links: a. 1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final b.

With an altitude variance of over 7,000 ft (2,100 m), the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park.

Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.\\nThe crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.\\nIn 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.

Scandinavian influence was dominant in the northern and western islands, Brythonic culture in the southwest, the Anglo-Saxon or English Kingdom of Northumbria in the southeast and the Pictish and Gaelic Kingdom of Alba in the east, north of the River Forth. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern Great Britain was increasingly dominated by Gaelic culture, and by the Gaelic regal lordship of Alba, known in Latin as either Albania or Scotia, and in English as \\"Scotland\\". From its base in the east, this kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south and ultimately the west and much of the north. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger Gaelic-speaking world and an economy dominated by agriculture and trade.\\nAfter the twelfth-century reign of King David I, the Scottish monarchs are better described as Scoto-Norman than Gaelic, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. A consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values including Canon law. The first towns, called burghs, appeared in the same era, and as they spread, so did the Middle English language. These developments were offset by the acquisition of the Norse-Gaelic west and the Gaelicisation of many of the noble families of French and Anglo-French origin. National cohesion was fostered with the creation of various unique religious and cultural practices. By the end of the period, Scotland experienced a \\"Gaelic revival\\", which created an integrated Scottish national identity.

To determine the sequence essential for frameshifting, substitution mutations were introduced within the region containing the run of adenines and were examined for their effects on frameshifting. Substitutions at each of three (2nd, 3rd and 4th) adenine residues in the run, which are recognized by tRNA Lys reading insA, caused serious defects in frameshifting, showing that the three adenine residues are essential for frameshifting. The effects of substitution mutations introduced in the region flanking the run of adenines and in the secondary structures located downstream were, however, small, indicating that such a region and structures are not essential for frameshifting. Deletion of a region containing the termination codon of insA caused a decrease in fi-galactosidase activity specified by the lacZ fusion plasmid in frame with B'-insB. Exchange of the wild-type termination codon of insA for a different one or introduction of an additional termination codon in the region upstream of the native termination codon caused an increase in fi-galactosidase activity, indicating that the termination codon in insA affects the efficiency of frameshifting. \\n Title: DNA sequences required for translational frameshifting in production of the transposase encoded by IS1","target":"False","rationale":"It provides general information about the DNA sequences required for translational frameshifting in production of the transposase encoded by insertion sequence IS1.

Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, each of which is about a quarter of the wavelength in length (an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths will also be resonant).

Passage:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of Râmnic, Buzău, Argeș, Roman, Huși and Lower Danube (Galați) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Philippe de Vitry (31 October 1291  9 June 1361) was a French composer, music theorist and poet. He was an accomplished, innovative, and influential composer, and may also have been the author of the \\"Ars Nova\\" treatise. He was widely acknowledged as the greatest musician of his day, with Petrarch writing a glowing tribute, calling him: \\"... the keenest and most ardent seeker of truth, so great a philosopher of our age.\\"\\n\\n- Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300  April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- Ars nova (Latin for new art) refers to a musical style which flourished in France and the Burgundian Low Countries in the Late Middle Ages: more particularly, in the period between the preparation of the \\"Roman de Fauvel\\" (1310s) and the death of the composer Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The term is sometimes used more generally to refer to all European polyphonic music of the 14th century. For instance, \\"Italian ars nova\\" is sometimes used to denote the music of Francesco Landini and his compatriots (although Trecento music is the more common term for music in Italy). The \\"ars\\" in \\"ars nova\\" can be read as \\"technique\\", or \\"style\\". The term was first used in two musical treatises, titled \\"Ars novae musicae\\" (New Technique of Music) (c. 1320) by Johannes de Muris, and a collection of writings (c. 1322) attributed to Philippe de Vitry often simply called \\"Ars nova\\" today. However, the term was only first used to describe an historical era by Johannes Wolf in 1904.\\n\\n- The Roman de Fauvel is a 14th-century French allegorical verse romance of satirical bent, generally attributed to Gervais du Bus, a clerk at the French royal chancery. The original narrative of 3,280 octosyllabics is divided into two books, dated to 1310 and 1314 respectively. In 13167 Chaillou de Pesstain produced a greatly expanded version.\\n\\n- Johannes de Muris ( c.1290 - c.1355 ) was a French philosopher , astronomer , mathematician , and music theorist best known for treatises on the ars nova , titled Ars nove musice . Life For a medieval person primarily known through his scholarly writing , it is highly unusual that Johannes de Muris '' life can be traced enough to form a decently consistent biography . Born in Normandy , he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France . The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7 , 1310 , which Muris was allegedly a part of . Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime , suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s . He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment . The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment . By 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in Evreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris . An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the Collège de Sorbonne until around 1325 . During this time it is believed that he travelled freely , making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321 . However , the double monastery of Fontevrault ( Maine0et - Loire ) was where he settled in March 1326 . He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to Evreux . Financial records in Muris '' own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year . In 1342 he was one of six cannons of the collegiate church in Mézières - en - Brenne . In 1344 , he was invited to Avignon by Pope Clement VI to participate in the calendar reform . The final date associated to Muris is 1345 in conjunction with the reforms that took place in Avignon .

In many real-world applications, access to the underlying transition operator is limited to a fixed set of data that has already been collected, without additional interaction with the environment being available. We show that consistent estimation remains possible in this scenario, and that effective estimation can still be achieved in important applications. Our approach is based on estimating a ratio that corrects for the discrepancy between the stationary and empirical distributions, derived from fundamental properties of the stationary distribution, and exploiting constraint reformulations based on variational divergence minimization. The resulting algorithm, GenDICE, is straightforward and effective. We prove the consistency of the method under general conditions, provide a detailed error analysis, and demonstrate strong empirical performance on benchmark tasks, including off-line PageRank and off-policy policy evaluation.","target":"In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm, GenDICE, for general stationary distribution correction estimation, which can handle both discounted and average off-policy evaluation on multiple behavior-agnostic samples","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm, GenDICE, for general stationary distribution correction estimation, which can handle both discounted and average off-policy evaluation on multiple behavior-agnostic samples."},{"source":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as acceptable (OPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable)","target":"to hurt his friends is stupid.","rationale":"Here's an example of a grammatically correct sentence: to hurt his friends is stupid."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a statement spoken by a politician in natural language and the subject of the discussion for the given statement.

After Albert's death in 1229, the crusaders secured the peaceful submission of Vanemane  by treaty in 1230. In the same year the papal vice-legat Baldouin of Alnea annulled this agreement and concluded an agreement with the ruler of Bandava in the central Courland Lamekins , delivering his kingdom into the hands of the papacy. Baldouin became the popes's delegate in Courland and bishop of Semigallia; however, the Germans complained about him to the Roman Curia, and in 1234 Pope Gregory IX removed Baldouin as his delegate. After their decisive defeat in the Battle of Saule by the Samogitians and Semigallians, the remnants of the Swordbrothers were reorganized in 1237 as a subdivision of the Teutonic Order, and became known as the Livonian Order. In 1242, under the leadership of the master of the Livonian Order Andrew of Groningen, the crusaders began the military conquest of Courland. They defeated the Curonians as far south as Embūte, near the contemporary border with Lithuania, and founded their main fortress at Kuldīga. In 1245 Pope Innocent IV allotted two thirds of conquered Courland to the Livonian Order, and one third to the Bishopric of Courland. At the Battle of Durbe in 1260 a force of Samogitians and Curonians overpowered the united forces of the Livonian and Teutonic Orders; over the following years, however, the Crusaders gradually subjugated the Curonians, and in 1267 concluded the peace treaty stipulating the obligations and the rights of their defeated rivals.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.

There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others.

In other countries, this is not a problem: in America, where a queue-jumper has committed a kind of rudeness rather than a sin, the response is a loud warning: the offender is simply told \\"Hey, you, get back in line!\\" or words to that effect. On the European continent, the reaction tends to be loud and argumentative; in some other parts of the world, queue-jumpers may simply be pushed back into line.

Improving adolescents' knowledge about SRH is necessary to improve health outcomes, however little is known about the information needs and preferences of adolescents in the Pacific to inform policy and programs in this region.\\", 'Sixty-six focus group discussions were conducted with 341 male and female adolescents aged 15-19 years from rural and urban communities on two islands of Vanuatu. Twelve key-informant interviews were also conducted with policymakers and health service providers. Data were analysed thematically using an inductive approach.', \\"Much of the SRH information targeting adolescents focused on sexually transmitted infections and HIV. While this information was valued, important gaps were identified including prevention of pregnancy, condom use, puberty, sexuality and relationships. Peer educators and health workers were adolescents' preferred sources of information because they were considered knowledgeable and trustworthy. Parents were not a common source but were preferred, particularly by girls, despite considerable socio-cultural barriers. Schools were an important but underutilised source of information, as were a range of media sources.\\nAnswer: Providing adolescents with comprehensive SRH information can have life-long protective benefits, however there are important content gaps in information currently provided in Vanuatu. The broad range of sources preferred by adolescents highlights the need to strengthen information provision through multiple channels to reach in and out-of-school youth and respond to individual needs and contexts.","target":"Are \`\` These issues n't talked about at home '' : a qualitative study of the sexual and reproductive health information preferences of adolescents in Vanuatu?","rationale":"The given question is ambiguous and could be answered in various ways, so it needs to be rephrased.

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract describes a new method for isolating hair follicles from rat skin and provides the number of intact, viable individual follicles that can be isolated using this technique (\\"large numbers\\").

When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, throwing a game with a large pot.  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny's bridge hand outside the pool hall (an homage to a similar scene in the classic pool film The Hustler).

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.\\nAugustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\".
