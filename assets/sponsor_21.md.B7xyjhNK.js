Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, protests about local racial segregation which began quietly in Franklin Street restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 Speaker Ban Law prohibiting speeches by communists on state campuses in North Carolina.  The law was immediately criticized by University Chancellor William Brantley Aycock and University President William Friday, but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965.  Small amendments to allow \\"infrequent\\" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to Marxist speaker Herbert Aptheker and civil liberties activist Frank Wilkinson; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened \\"Dan Moore's Wall\\" by The Daily Tar Heel for Governor Dan K. Moore. A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court, and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. In 1968, only a year after its schools became fully integrated, Chapel Hill became the first predominantly white municipality in the country to elect an African American mayor, Howard Lee.

The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders.

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Health Education 3)Human","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a novel method for the isolation of large numbers of intact, viable hair follicles from rat skin in order to study their biology.

It is the home of The Royal Opera, The Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the Theatre Royal, it served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, Handel's first season of operas began.

After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16-7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run. With the win, the Vikings not only improved to 11-2 on the season, they also secured a playoff berth for the second consecutive season and improved upon the record from the previous season (10-6). Their \\"magic number\\" decreased to one, meaning that either a Green Bay loss at Pittsburgh or a Vikings win against Carolina on Sunday night would make Minnesota repeat division champions for the first time since 1978, when they won six consecutive NFC Central titles.

The reforms encouraged Ottomanism among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire, attempting to stem the tide of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". \\n\\n- Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish:    \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.\\n\\n- Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish:   \\"Mahmud-u sn\\",   \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785  1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I.\\n\\n- The ecumene (US) or oecumene (UK \\"oikoumén\\",  \\"inhabited\\") was an ancient Greek term for the known world, the inhabited world, or the habitable world. Under the Roman Empire, it came to refer to civilization and the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is used as the noun form of \\"ecumenical\\" and describes the Christian Church as a unified whole or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in cartography to describe a type of world map (\\"mappa mundi\\") used in late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.\\n\\n- Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike.\\n\\n- Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. \\n\\n- The Council of Chalcedon (or ) was a church council held from October 8 to November 1, AD 451, at Chalcedon. The Council is numbered as the fourth ecumenical council by the Great Church. A minority of Christians do not agree with the council's teachings. Its most important achievement was to issue the Chalcedonian Definition. The Council's judgements and definitions regarding the divine marked a significant turning point in the Christological debates. Chalcedon was a city in Bithynia, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus; today the city it is part of the Republic of Turkey and is known as Kadköy (a district of Istanbul).\\n\\n- Anthimos V ( Greek :   ' ) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople for thirteen months from 1841 to 1842 . He was born in Raidestos ( Tekirda ) and served as Metropolitan of Agathoupolis between 1815 and 1821 , Anchialos between 1821 and 1831 , and Kyzikos between 1831 and 1841 . He was appointed Ecumenical Patriarch when Patriarch Anthimos IV was dismissed by Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I. He died in 1842 and was succeeded by Germanos IV.\\n\\n- The Ecumenical Patriarch (\\"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch\\") is the Archbishop of ConstantinopleNew Rome and ranks as \\"primus inter pares\\" (first among equals) among the heads of the several autocephalous churches that make up the Eastern Orthodox Church, and is widely regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of the 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The term \\"Ecumenical\\" in the title historically referred to the Ecumene, a Greek designation for the civilised universe, i.e. the Roman Empire, and legally stems from Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon.\\n\\n- The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to March 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \\"greater confusion of purpose\\", yet led to a war noted for its \\"notoriously incompetent international butchery.\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'place of death' with the subject 'anthimus v of constantinople'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1923\\n - africa\\n - alliance\\n - anatolia\\n - battle\\n - bithynia\\n - central\\n - chalcedon\\n - constantine\\n - constantinople\\n - english channel\\n - france\\n - french republic\\n - imperial\\n - istanbul\\n - italy\\n - march\\n - marseille\\n - mediterranean sea\\n - moscow\\n - most\\n - novosibirsk\\n - ottoman empire\\n - paris\\n - re\\n - roma\\n - roman\\n - roman empire\\n - rome\\n - russia\\n - russian empire\\n - saint petersburg\\n - samara\\n - sardinia\\n - sea\\n - switzerland\\n - topkapı palace\\n - turkey\\n - union\\n - united kingdom","target":"istanbul","rationale":"Anthimus V of Constantinople was an Ecumenical Patriarch during the Ottoman Empire.

Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. \\n \\"I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,\\" Jennie said. \\"There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. \\"\\nJennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. \\"Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,\\" Jennie said. \\" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. \\"\\nThree weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. \\"I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. \\" She said, \\"So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend.

He grew up in Northern New Jersey and attended Glen Ridge High School.\\n\\nIn 2005, Ezra formed the alternative rock band Vampire Weekend. The name of the group was in reference to an unreleased indie film of the same name that Ezra and his friends produced during a vacation. In the film, Ezra portrayed protagonist, Walcott, a man hell-bent on escaping Cape Cod as he believed vampires were coming. Many songs from the bands eponymous release made reference to the film.  Ezra met his bandmates at Columbia University, prior to 2003. After already having met drummer, Chris Tomson, Koenig became aquatinted with Rostam Batmanglij. The two immediately bonded over Radiohead at a party during freshman year and vowed to start a band one day. Rounding out the group was Chris Baio, Koenig's suite-mate in his sophomore year, and they shared a love of Destiny's Child. The group immediately got to work, playing their first show in 2006 at a battle of the bands in a campus basement. They placed third out of four. Later that year, some of their demos appeared online, earning raves from sites like Stereogum and Pitchfork. Before they knew it, they were selling out shows and appearing on the cover of Spin without even having released an album.  Their eponymous debut album arrived in January 2008, and by the end of the year they had performed on Saturday Night Live, played for 40,000 fans at England's Glastonbury festival and sold nearly half a million albums. The album was self-produced whilst they were working full-time jobs. Since then, the band have released two additional albums, Contra and Modern Vampires of the City.  The band has been nominated for multiple Grammy Awards. In 2011, Contra was nominated for Best Alternative Album, however the band lost to The Black Keys.

The offenses struggled in the first quarter, and the first points would actually come via special teams in the second quarter, when Ted Ginn Jr. returned a punt 87 yards to paydirt for Miami. Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J. Feeley was spun up to play quarterback, but threw an interception of his own on his first drive. In the third quarter, Correll Buckhalter took the ball in from eight yards out for the go-ahead touchdown, making it 10-7. Feeley, after some helpful runs from running back Brian Westbrook, connected with receiver Jason Avant to increase the lead. The defense played a strong second half, and Westbrook carried seven times on the final drive, which killed the final 6:40 of the game. Without McNabb, Andy Reid leaned hard on Westbrook, who shattered his career-high with 32 carries, while picking up 148 yards. McNabb's post-game x-rays were negative. The win marked the first time Philadelphia had won consecutive games all season, as well as allowing them to reach .500 and remain in the playoff hunt in the NFC.\\n\\nHow many more times did the Eagles score than the dolphins?","target":"2","rationale":"To answer this question, we need to check how many times each team scored. The Eagles only scored twice: once by Correll Buckhalter taking the ball in from eight yards out for a touchdown and another time when Feeley connected with receiver Jason Avant. On the other hand, Dolphins had one score and that is Ted Ginn Jr.'s 87-yard punt return for a touchdown. Therefore it can be concluded that 2 - 1 = 1 more scores were made than touchdowns by the Eagles compared to those of Dolphins"},{"source":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\\nArticle: The Great Fire of London started in the very early hours of September 2,1666.In four days it destroyed more than three quarters of the old city,where most of those houses were built out of wood and close together.One hundred thousand people became homeless but only few lost their lives.The fire started on Sunday moring.By eight o'clock three hundred houses were on fire.On Monday nearly a kilometer of the city was burning along the River Thames.Tuesday was the worst day.The fire destroyed many well-known buildings.\\nThe fire stopped only when the king finally ordered people to destroy hundreds of buildings in the path  of the fire.With nothing left to burn,the fire became weak and finally died out.\\nOptions:\\nA Sunday.\\nB Monday.\\nC Tuesday.\\nD Wednesday.\\nAnswer:\\nA Sunday.\\nQuestion:","target":"What day die the Great Fire happen in London?","rationale":"Here's the question: \\"What day die the Great Fire happen in London?\\"\\nAnd here's the rationale, with one possible explanation: \\n\\"The article talks about how many days it took to stop.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Passage:As Chancellor Kohl was strongly committed to European integration and French–German cooperation in particular; he was also a steadfast ally of the United States and supported Reagan's more aggressive policies in order to weaken the Soviet Union. Kohl's 16-year tenure was the longest of any German Chancellor since Otto von Bismarck. He oversaw the end of the Cold War and the German reunification, for which he is generally known as Chancellor of Unity. Together with French President François Mitterrand, Kohl was the architect of the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union (EU) and the euro currency. Kohl was also a central figure in the eastern enlargement of the European Union, and his government led the effort to push for international recognition of Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina when the states declared independence. He played an instrumental role in solving the Bosnian War. Domestically, Kohl's policies focused on economic reforms and later also on the process of integrating the former East Germany into the reunited Germany, and he moved the federal capital from the \\"provisional capital\\" Bonn back to Berlin, although he himself never resided there because the government offices were only relocated in 1999. Kohl also greatly increased federal spending on arts and culture. After his chancellorship, Kohl's reputation suffered domestically because of his role in the CDU donations scandal and he had to resign from his honorary chairmanship of the CDU after little more than a year in January 2000, but he was partly rehabilitated in later years. The later Chancellor Angela Merkel started her political career as Kohl's protegée.\\n Links: a. Ronald Reagan b. Bonn c. François Mitterrand d.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'\\n\\nCLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Hey all,\\nSome back story here. I live in HCMC Vietnam. I have rented an apartment in a nice upscale apartment building for the last two years. Each apartment is privately owned, and we have an HOA in charge of management of the building. The HOA board is in charge of hiring a managing/service company to oversee services such as security, cleaning, etc. This year we elected a new woman in charge of the HOA, and she promptly fired the old company and hired another contractor. I work from a home office, which is relevant to this story.\\n\\nI order food often. Food and delivery here is really cheap, and I can order from essentially any restaurant in the city far cheaper than I could personally cook a meal. We are talking like $3 delivered to your door. I'll often order coffee or whatever as well. My girlfriend doesn't much care for western food, so sometimes we will order from different places. This essentially equates to like 3-7 deliveries a day.\\n\\nHow this worked in my building is what you would expect from a hotel or an office.\\n\\nThe delivery guy talks to the woman at the front desk and she calls my apartment. I confirm I am expecting a delivery, he has to sign in and she escorts him to the elevator and allows him entry to my floor. Everything in the building is key-card access, and the delivery guy can only go to my floor and back to ground.\\n\\nThis morning I woke up and there was a sign posted in the lobby which stated that this procedure was \\"unsafe\\" and that tenants of the building will have to go down to retrieve any deliveries.\\n\\nI talked to the security guy and the girl at the reception desk why this policy was put in place and they told me that the woman in charge of the HOA spent an entire day in the lobby of the building and counted delivery people coming in and out of the building and arbitrarily decided there were too many. We have never had any theft or break ins, everything is very tightly controlled here with cameras and security at essentially every exit, 24 hours a day.\\n\\nNow this policy frankly pisses me off. Ever since the new company has taken over, my desire to stay in this apartment has decreased significantly, but I have a lease and don't want to lose my two month deposit so I'm a bit stuck. It takes me 10-15 minutes farting around with the elevator which should normally be like a 5 second transaction with a delivery guy.\\n\\nI have tried talking to this woman about how much of an inconvenience this is. She has ignored me entirely or had the girl at the front desk run interference.\\n\\nI've decided that I would fight fire with fire and I've started ordering deliveries of bottled water to the woman who runs the HOA and I've paid the security guy to let me know if she let's anyone into the building. I've also paid a photocopy shop to deliver 100 copies of a letter every day this week saying I disagree with the policy.\\n\\nTomorrow I have a meeting with the company that sells ads in the elevators for the building, and I intend to buy a TV sized ad expressing my dislike for this policy.\\n\\nMy girlfriend agrees that the policy is bullshit but she says I am taking this too far. It'd be cheaper for me to run the ad and try to change the policy so I don't have to move than break my lease.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? How far should I take the petty revenge. My idea is if this woman is inconvenienced in the same way she is inconveniencing me, she will change the policy, but I live in a country where this form of protest (or really, any form of protest, since politically it's illegal) is seriously looked down upon.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is quite pissed off about this, because I'm causing a scene, but it is enough of an issue to me I feel like I'd like to see it through.\\n\\nWhat say you, Reddit?","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning whether or not it was appropriate to retaliate against a new policy put in place by their HOA.\\n\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe events that occurred, including talking to security personnel and people at reception. The author also mentions several actions they have already taken, including ordering water and photocopies as well as paying someone to let them know when someone is allowed into their building.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the above analysis, it seems that this situation has already occurred.

Born in Philadelphia, he studied classics at Yale, but was expelled for participating in the Conic Sections Rebellion. He then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the same year, where he received an A.B. degree in 1832. He went on to get an A.M. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1835 and in 1836 an M.D. from the school's department of medicine. He settled to practice in his native city, but spent parts of 1841 and 1851 in Paris and Vienna. From 1854 to 1859 he was professor of medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical College and from 1864 to 1884 at the University of Pennsylvania, later becoming its Chair. Stillé was one of the first in America to distinguish between typhus and typhoid fever. His observations in this connection he made during a typhus epidemic in Philadelphia in 1836 and reported in 1838. He acquired a great reputation as a practitioner, teacher, and writer, and was the first secretary, and in 1871–72 the president, of the American Medical Association.

That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...","target":"Philip Heseltine","rationale":"The question asks for the name of Philip Heseltine, whose music was presented in a memorial concert. \\nIn the passage above, we can find \\"Philip Heseltine\\" mentioned several times when describing his death and its aftermath.

Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails.

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries.

His true name is revealed to be Bercilak de Hautdesert in \\"Sir Gawain\\", while \\"The Greene Knight\\" names him \\"Bredbeddle\\". The Green Knight later appears as one of Arthur's greatest champions in the fragmentary ballad \\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\", again under the name \\"Bredbeddle\\". In \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\", Bercilak is transformed into the Green Knight by Morgan le Fay, a traditional adversary of King Arthur, in order to test his court. In \\"The Green Knight\\" he is transformed by a different woman for the same purpose. In both stories he sends his wife to seduce Gawain as a further test. \\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\" portrays him as an exorcist and one of the most powerful knights in Arthur's court.\\n\\n- King's College London (informally King's or KCL) is a public research university located in London, United Kingdom, and a founding constituent college of the federal University of London. King's was established in 1829 by King George IV and the Duke of Wellington and received its royal charter in the same year. In 1836, King's became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London. In the late 20th century, it grew through a series of mergers, including with Queen Elizabeth College and Chelsea College of Science and Technology (in 1985), the Institute of Psychiatry (in 1997), the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals and the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery (in 1998).\\n\\n- A quest serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.\\n\\n- A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \\n\\n- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892  2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\".\\n\\n- Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820  13 August 1910) was an English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing.\\n\\n- Gawain (English: , Welsh: ; also called \\"Gwalchmei\\", \\"Gualguanus\\", \\"Gauvain\\", \\"Walwein\\", etc.) is King Arthur's nephew and a Knight of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. Under the name \\"Gwalchmei\\", he appears very early in the legend's development, being mentioned in some of the earliest Welsh Arthurian sources.\\n\\n- Bob and wheel is the common name for a metrical device most famously used by the Pearl Poet in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\". The feature is found mainly in Middle English and Middle Scots poetry, where the bob and wheel occur typically at the end of a stanza. The \\"bob\\" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the \\"wheel,\\" longer lines with internal rhyme. There are at least forty known examples of bob and wheel use, but the origin of the form is obscure. It seems to predate the Pearl Poet. Bob and wheel is not used often in modern poetry.\\n\\n- In prosody, alliterative verse is a form of verse that uses alliteration as the principal ornamental device to help indicate the underlying metrical structure, as opposed to other devices such as rhyme. The most commonly studied traditions of alliterative verse are those found in the oldest literature of the Germanic languages, where scholars use the term 'alliterative poetry' rather broadly to indicate a tradition which not only shares alliteration as its primary ornament but also certain metrical characteristics. The Old English epic \\"Beowulf\\", as well as most other Old English poetry, the Old High German \\"Muspilli\\", the Old Saxon \\"Heliand\\", the Old Norse \\"Poetic Edda\\", and many Middle English poems such as \\"Piers Plowman\\", \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\", and the \\"Alliterative Morte Arthur\\" all use alliterative verse.\\n\\n- Queen Elizabeth College (QEC) had its origins in the Ladies' (later Women's) Department of King's College, London, England, opened in 1885. The first King's 'extension' lectures for ladies were held at Richmond in 1871, and from 1878 in Kensington, with chaperones in attendance.\\n\\n- A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good.\\n\\n- Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: \\"Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyt\\") is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance. It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important poem in the romance genre, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R.

In 1985, it merged with King's College London.\\n\\n- As a literary genre of high culture, romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight-errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest, yet it is \\"the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the \\"chanson de geste\\" and other kinds of epic, in which masculine military heroism predominates.\\" Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c. 1600 they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in his novel \\"Don Quixote\\". Still, the modern image of \\"medieval\\" is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word \\"medieval\\" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes.\\n\\n- Simon Robert Armitage CBE (born 26 May 1963) is an English poet, playwright and novelist.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'ronald alan waldron'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- duke\\n - faculty\\n - fashion\\n - game\\n - hero\\n - king\\n - knight\\n - literary\\n - major\\n - monarch\\n - philologist\\n - playwright\\n - plowman\\n - poet\\n - professor\\n - r\\n - research\\n - science\\n - social reformer\\n - statistician\\n - united kingdom\\n - writer","target":"writer","rationale":"The information above is a list of objects and their definitions.

Passage:The formation and development of Hurricane Audrey was multi-faceted. One contributor to Audrey's formation—an area of anomalously low pressures roughly above sea level—was traced back to its first detection in the western Caribbean Sea on June 11. In an analysis of weather patterns from June 1957, Weather Bureau meteorologist William H. Klein noted the potential for research on similar disturbances to shed light on tropical cyclone development. Concurrently, surface observations suggested the progression of a disorganized tropical wave tracking westward across the Caribbean Sea beginning on June 20, eventually entering the Bay of Campeche on June 22. At 12:00 UTC on June 24 (7:00 a.m. CST), the resulting disturbance organized into a tropical depression based on ship reports in the bay; at the time, the first indication of a developing tropical cyclone originated from a report from a shrimp boat. The depression was in a highly favorable environment for intensification in the western Gulf of Mexico; sea surface temperatures in the area were at , or 3 °F (2 °C) above normal for the time of year. In addition, the latitudinal alignment of a polar trough over the Great Plains and the nascent disturbance in the Bay of Campeche created an environment suitable for outflow in the upper-levels of the atmosphere. Taking advantage of these conditions, Audrey reached tropical storm strength just six hours after being classified as a tropical depression while remaining nearly stationary.","target":"b","rationale":"The question about the depth of water where Audrey was first noticed can't be answered using the passage, even though it contains information about the location of Audrey's formation."},{"source":"Answer the question below:\\n\\n\\nA very efficient pair of solar panels will produce little energy or a lot of energy? \\n\\n\\nAssuming that:\\n\\nThe more efficient a device is, the greater the percentage of usable energy it produces.","target":"a lot of energy","rationale":"This question is answered by using the information provided in the context.

While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

Physiological parameters and histological changes were assessed, RIF was evaluated using Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were determined, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured using immunohistochemistry or western blotting analysis.

Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet to the music of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, \\"Our music was, like, [the Doors'], but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool.\\" In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.By 2000, all band members had part-time jobs and were practicing new material several nights a week in a small hired recording space. In the fall of that year, their demo caught the attention of Ryan Gentles, a talent booker at New York City's Mercury Lounge. He scheduled the Strokes for four December gigs. With support from personal mentor JP Bowersock and producer Gordon Raphael, the band recorded three tracks which later appeared on Is This It: \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Last Nite\\", and \\"Barely Legal\\". British label Rough Trade Records was impressed by the songs and released them as a January 2001 extended play titled The Modern Age. Music press reaction was very positive and the Strokes embarked on a sold-out UK tour, followed by US support slots for alternative rock groups Doves and Guided by Voices.

She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two.\\nAs the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.\\nWhen Molina declares herself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades.

This is a good piece of advice. If you go shopping for food before lunchtime, you'll probably buy more than you plan to. Unfortunately, however, just this advice isn't enough for shoppers these days. Modern shoppers need an education in how and how not to buy things at the store. First, you check the weekly newspaper ads. Find out the items that are on sale and decide if you really need these things. In other words, don't buy anything just because it's cheaper than usual! Second, never let \\"New and Improved!\\" or \\"All Natural\\" on the front of a package influence you. Instead, read the list of contents on the back. Third,compare prices: that is, you should examine the prices of both different brands and different sizes of the same brand.\\nAnother suggestion for shoppers is to buy ordinary items instead of famous brands. Ordinary items in supermarkets come in plain packages. These products are cheaper because producers don't spend much money on packing or advertising. However, they are still of high quality. In the same way, in buying clothes, you can often find high quality and low prices in brands that are not famous. Shopping in discount clothing stores can help you save a lot of money. Although these stores aren't very attractive, and they usually do not have individual dressing rooms, not only are the prices low, but you can often find the same famous brands that you find in high-priced department stores.\\nWise shoppers read magazine ads and watch TV commercials ,but they do this with one advantage: knowledge of the psychology behind the ads. In other words, will-informed shoppers watch for information and check for misinformation. They ask themselves questions: Is the advertiser hiding something in small print at the bottom of the page? Is there any real information in the commercial, or is the advertiser simply showing an attractive image? With the answers to these questions, shoppers can make a wise choice.\\nQuestion: We can learn from the passage that   _  .\\nOptions: A: ordinary items are not so attractive because of the lower prices .\\nB: we can't buy items with words like \\"New and Improved\\" or \\"All Natural\\".\\nC: the advertisers are always showing misinformation in the commercial.\\nD: the quality of ordinary items can be as good as that of famous brands.","target":"D","rationale":"A: In the passage, it says that ordinary items in supermarkets come in plain packages.

Passage 1:In 1996 Guillermo Martinez began wrestling under the name \\"Bombero Infernal\\", complete with a mask and ring gear adorned in flames and diabolical images. He had only worked under that name for just over a year when he became involved in a storyline feud against El Pantera, the rivalry escalated to the point where both wrestlers agreed to put their masks on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre. The match took place on December 7, 1997 in International Wrestling Revolution Group's (IWRG) Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico with Bombero Infernal losing the match, which forced him to unmask in the middle of the ring, state his birthname and how long he had been a wrestler. Oftentimes losing the mask means the end of a specific ring character, but Martinez stuck with the Bombero Infernal ring characters in the years after his loss. On January 10, 1999 Bombero Infernal won the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Mr. Niebla and held the championship for 146 days straight. The title change was part of a long running storyline between Bombero and Mr. Niebla that saw Mr. Niebla regain the championship on June 6, 1999 but ultimately lose it to Bombero Infernal once again on October 24, 1999. His second reign ended at the hands of Último Vampiro on December 16, 1999 when he defeated Bombero Infernal. In late 2000 Bombero Infernal teamed up with Cripta and El Enterrador to defeat the team of Super Caló, Alan Stone and Moto Cross to win the Distrito Federal Trios Championship. On November 19, 2000 Bombero Infernal regained the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Último Vampiro. Bombero's time as a double champion ended on February 11, 2001 when Los Oficiales (Guardia, Oficial and Virgilante) won the DF Trios Championship. A month later he also lost the Middleweight Championship to Black Dragon. Later that year Bombero Infernal defeated Último Vampiro to win the Middleweight Championship for a fourth time, at the time someone other than the previous Último Vampiro was playing the character. The match between the two ended in a controversial fashion, leading IWRG to take the championship away from Bombero Infernal only one week later. In 2002 Bombero Infernal rekindled his storyline with El Pantera, going so far as to put his hair on the line against Pantera's Middleweight Championship, in a match that saw Bombero victoriously claim his fifth IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship. His fifth reign lasted 95 days in total before it coming to an end when Tony Rivera defeated him. On November 11, 2002 Bombero Infernal, El Hijo del Diablo and El Engendro defeated Dr. Cerebro, Cirujano and Paramedico to win the DF Trios Championship once again, a title they would quickly lose to a new group called Los Megas (Mega, Omega and Ultra Mega)\\n Passage 2:The Melrose Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.

Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker.

Most biblical scholars now agree that these were not separate individuals and that John the apostle wrote the Book of Revelation.  John the Presbyter, an obscure figure in the early church, has also been identified with the seer of the Book of Revelation by such authors as Eusebius in his Church History (Book III, 39)  and Jerome.  John is considered to have been exiled to Patmos, during the persecutions under Emperor Domitian. Revelation 1:9 says that the author wrote the book on Patmos: \\"I, John, both your brother and companion in tribulation... was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\\" Adela Yarbro Collins, a biblical scholar at Yale Divinity School, writes:  Early tradition says that John was banished to Patmos by the Roman authorities. This tradition is credible because banishment was a common punishment used during the Imperial period for a number of offenses. Among such offenses were the practices of magic and astrology. Prophecy was viewed by the Romans as belonging to the same category, whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian. Prophecy with political implications, like that expressed by John in the book of Revelation, would have been perceived as a threat to Roman political power and order. Three of the islands in the Sporades were places where political offenders were banished. (Pliny Natural History 4.69-70; Tacitus Annals 4.30)  Some modern higher critical scholars have raised the possibility that John the Apostle, John the Evangelist, and John of Patmos were three separate individuals. These scholars assert that John of Patmos wrote Revelation but neither the Gospel of John nor the Epistles of John. For one, the author of Revelation identifies himself as \\"John\\" several times, but the author of the Gospel of John never identifies himself directly. Some Catholic scholars state that \\"vocabulary, grammar, and style make it doubtful that the book could have been put into its present form by the same person(s) responsible for the fourth gospel.\\"\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"Who authored the book?","rationale":"The best answer to this question is \\"Who authored the book?\\"\\nThis article explains different points of view regarding who may have written the Book of Revelation.

He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze.\\n\\nIn June 2010, investigative reporter Alexander Zaitchik released a critical biography titled Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance, with a title mocking Beck's work, Common Sense. In an interview about the book, Zaitchik theorized, \\"Beck's politics and his insatiable hunger for money and fame are not mutually exclusive\\", while stating:  Beck's true religion is not Patriotism, Mormonism, or Conservatism. His true religion is cross-platform self-marketing ... According to Beck's worldview, there's no inherent contradiction between his sophisticated instinct for self-promotion, his propagandist rodeo clown act, his self-image as a media mogul, and his professed belief system. I think he actually believes that God wants him to make a ton of money and become this huge celebrity by fear mongering and generally doing whatever it takes in the media to promote right-wing causes.  In September 2010, Philadelphia Daily News reporter Will Bunch released The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama. One of Bunch's theses is that Beck is nothing more than a morning zoo deejay playing a fictional character as a money-making stunt. Writer Bob Cesca, in a review of Bunch's book, compares Beck to Steve Martin's faith-healer character in the 1992 film Leap of Faith, before describing the \\"derivative grab bag of other tried and tested personalities\\" that Bunch contends comprises Beck's persona:  His (Beck's) adenoidal 'Clydie Clyde' voice is based on morning zoo pioneer Scott Shannon's \\"Mr. Leonard\\" character. His history is borrowed from the widely debunked work of W. Cleon Skousen. His conspiracy theories are horked from Alex Jones and maybe Jack Van Impe. His anti-Obama, anti-socialist monologues are pure Joe McCarthy. His chalkboard is stolen from televangelist Gene Scott. His solemn, over-processed radio monologue delivery is a dead ringer for Eric Bogosian in Talk Radio.

Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.\\nAt a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.\\nThe incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial.

Dunlap, Jr. adds that the U.S. Air Force's culture also includes an egalitarianism bred from officers perceiving themselves as their service's principal \\"warriors\\" working with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or the onboard crew of their aircraft. Air Force officers have never felt they needed the formal social \\"distance\\" from their enlisted force that is common in the other U.S. armed services. Although the paradigm is changing, for most of its history, the Air Force, completely unlike its sister services, has been an organization in which mostly its officers fought, not its enlisted force, the latter being primarily a rear echelon support force. When the enlisted force did go into harm's way, such as members of multi-crewed aircraft, the close comradeship of shared risk in tight quarters created traditions that shaped a somewhat different kind of officer/enlisted relationship than exists elsewhere in the military.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"members","rationale":"The question is asking for the term used to describe \\"the people that belong to an association or club\\".

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20]\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which year was the subtropical ridge suppressed to the south?","target":"2019","rationale":"The subtropical ridge is a belt of high pressure that circles the globe. It lies 30 to 35 degrees north and south of the equator, between 20°N and 50°S latitude in both hemispheres. The ridges are responsible for dry weather in their respective regions by causing sinking motions at ground level which suppress precipitation formation.\\n2018 was wet because it had an unusually strong Subtropical Ridge (this phenomenon does not have much variability). But 2019 was a drought year; this means that during 2019 there were less clouds so more sunlight could reach Earth's surface than 2018, probably due to weaker or suppressed Subtropical Ridges over land areas like North America including Four Corners region where they do affect Southwestern US climate strongly enough as mentioned above"},{"source":"Frank E.

Incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the conversion of [3H]25OHD3 to a more polar vitamin D3 metabolite (up to 15 pmol/10(6) cells). Untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite. Several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin D3, namely 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. (1) The metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. (2) The metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor as authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3. (3) The biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo (stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3. The LPS-stimulated synthesis of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng LPS/10(6) cells. Polymyxin B abolished the effects of LPS on 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages. Our data suggest that LPS-stimulated macrophages can modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes a lot of numerical values and measurements, such as the amount of LPS used to stimulate macrophage production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (100-200ng/10(6) cells), the dose-dependent response curves observed (linear relationship between LPS dose and 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages), the affinity of the macrophage metabolite for its receptor compared to authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3 (similar affinity), etc. As a result, it is clear that numerical data plays an important role in this study.

Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno \\"on message\\", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a few hundred dollars of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it was comprised. She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel.

One postulated reason for these conflicting results is an abnormal sensitivity to the intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D3). Previous studies in everted duodenal sacs and perfused duodenum examined the acute response to 1,25D3 only in 12-week-old SHR, which however already had higher basal rates of calcium absorption. Inability to stimulate Ca absorption further was an unexcluded possibility. To test this hypothesis more vigorously, balance and in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake studies were performed in SHR and WKy using four separate protocols yielding the following results. First, in response to pharmacological doses of 1,25D3 (25 ng/100 g body wt/day X 3), four-week-old normotensive female SHR had higher net calcium absorption (41.4 vs. 31.1 mg/day; 61.6 vs. 48.1%), similar to the increases seen in the untreated state. These results suggest intrinsic epithelial differences independent of 1,25D3. Ca absorption was similarly higher in 1,25D3 treated male SHR (42.9 vs. 36.7 mg/day; 60.1 vs. 53.7%). Second, at 12 to 14 weeks of age, low doses of 1,25D3 (8 ng/100 g body wt/day X 6) stimulated net Ca absorption in the female SHR (33.0 to 39.1 mg/day), but not in WKy (26.8 to 29.3 mg/day). In the male, positive effects were again seen only in the SHR (25 to 45 mg/day). Third, in response to three weeks of dietary Ca deprivation, in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake, measured in the conscious awake state, was higher in 35-week-old SHR (70.9 vs. 53.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Aging","rationale":"The abstract discusses the age-related changes in calcium absorption in SHR and WKY rats. The main findings are that at 4 weeks of age, there are no differences in calcium absorption between the two groups, but at 12-14 weeks of age and 35 weeks of age, SHR rats absorb more calcium than WKY rats. These results suggest that aging may be a factor that affects intestinal calcium absorption. So I think \\"Aging\\" is a suitable keyword for this paper because it captures what the abstract discusses and highlights one key point: there is an increase in calcium absorption as rats get older, but this change only occurs after 12-14 weeks of age, so aging may be a factor (in addition to other factors) involved with increased intestinal calcium absorption.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given an impractical statement.

Built in 1986 by former funny car driver Billy Meyer, the Motorplex was the first National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) \\"super track.\\" It annually hosts the AAA Texas NHRA FallNationals each October, when hundreds of professional and amateur drag racers compete for over $2 million in prize money. Past winners have included John Force, Kenny Bernstein, and Tony Schumacher. Perhaps the one identifying feature of the track, is that from the burnout pad, to the shutdown area, it is the only all concrete strip within the NHRA's schedule of events.\\n\\n- Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.\\n\\n- In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.\\n\\n- Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.\\n\\n- Ennis is a city in Ellis County, Texas, United States, located south of Dallas. The population was 18,513 at the 2010 census, up from 16,454 at the 2000 census.

Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The Texas State Capitol is tall, making it the sixth tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n- A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.\\n\\n- San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States.

He graduated with a B.S. and M.A. in Physics and did extensive theoretical and experimental research on the Mössbauer effect . He died in San Diego on February 4 , 2010 after a period of illness . Holliday became one of the first 100 employees of Tracor in 1962 and quickly became Director of Analysis and Applied Research in the Electronic Systems Division . In 1965 Holliday left Austin to develop the Tracor facility in San Diego and began his doctorate in applied physics at the University of California , San Diego . In San Diego Holliday began his study in acoustics for which he is known . His study of transient flow in natural gas pipelines led to the publication of a textbook which is still used as a standard reference . In the 1970s Holliday began testing a revolutionary technique for the detection and size measurement of zooplankton in thin layers involving multi-frequency backscattering . The technique developed and after twenty years became the established framework for research in the field . In the early 1980s Holliday built the first prototype of the Tracor Acoustical Profiling System ( TAPS ) which has been described as decades ahead of its time by the Acoustical Society of America . TAPS is now the standard instrument for acoustical profiling of plankton in the sea . Holliday published hundreds of papers on underwater acoustics and acoustical oceanography and given dozens of talks and symposia in several countries . In 2004 Holliday became only the third recipient of the Acoustical Society of America Silver Medal in Acoustical Oceanography , for \`\` contributions to the study of marine life , from plankton to whales '' .

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership.

In the 2-3 years of racing that Rex did, viewers were divided, calling him both brave and a coward. However, it was during the final leg of the Casa Cristo road rally that Rex died in a fiery crash in the Maltese Ice Caves. After this event, Speed continued racing, with his lost Brother constantly on his mind.Now the prime driver for Racer Motors, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill, driving the \\"Mach 6\\" of his father's design, but remains interested only in the art of the race and the well-being of his family. Speed father is still adamant that Racer Motors continue to be an independent in a sport where almost everyone is owned by a large corporation.Shortly after Speed's most recent win, Mr. Royalton (Roger Allam), owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, shows up at the family's doorstep. Inviting the Racer family to tour his company, Speed is somewhat impressed, yet a little apprehensive. Royalton gives Speed a week to consider his offer.Speed eventually returns to Royalton, and declines his offer, citing that racing is more of a family affair for him.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current.

This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","target":"Ural","rationale":"The paragraph states that Rob visited the Alps mountains in Austria last year and saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier.

While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.

At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had \\"never been any of these things, in any profound sense\\". Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. In the early 20th century, Russell led the British \\"revolt against idealism\\".\\n\\nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and commenced his studies there in 1890, taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.  Russell first met the American Quaker Alys Pearsall Smith when he was 17 years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family - they knew him primarily as \\"Lord John's grandson\\" and enjoyed showing him off. He traveled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.  He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation. During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Lady Ottoline Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S.

We report here the first study of the individual ion channels mediating potassium buffering by glial cells. The patch-clamp technique was employed to record single channel currents in Muller cells, the radial glia of the vertebrate retina. Those cells have 94% of their potassium conductance in an endfoot apposed to the vitreous humour, causing K+ released from active retinal neurones to be buffered preferentially to the vitreous. Recordings from patches of endfoot and cell body membrane show that a single type of inward-rectifying K+ channel mediates potassium buffering at both cell locations. The non-uniform density of K+ conductance is due to a non-uniform distribution of one type of K+ channel, rather than to the cell expressing high conductance channels at the endfoot and low conductance channels elsewhere on the cell.","target":"Ambystoma","rationale":"The abstract focuses on the function of glial cells in the central nervous system, which is to buffer extracellular potassium concentration.

This new army, placed under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum of the XX Corps, served as one of the two wings in Sherman's March to the Sea. The Army of the Tennessee, consisting of the XV and XVII Corps, commanded by Oliver O. Howard, served as the other wing. The Army of Georgia was involved in little fighting during the March to the Sea but was engaged in the Battle of Averasborough and bore the brunt of fighting at the Battle of Bentonville.\\n Passage 3:The movie opens as Josh Nichols (Josh Peck) runs into the kitchen and tries to tell his step-sister Megan Parker (Miranda Cosgrove) how he got into a prestigious creative writing class. She, however, makes a smoothie, which drowns out his conversation. He and his step-brother, Drake Parker's (Drake Bell) parents Audrey and Walter (Nancy Sullivan, Jonathan Goldstein) are to take a ten-day cruise to Acapulco, during which Megan will stay at a friend’s house in Denver. Josh begins to write a story about his greatest adventure for his class but is unable to recall one, concluding that he has a boring life. Meanwhile, Drake's band manager let a great gig slip through his fingers, and Drake and his band then have to perform at the \\"B'Nai Shalom Home for The Elderly.\\" Drake, enraged, fires his current manager and lets Josh take his place. Shortly before their parents’ departure, Drake selfishly leaves for over an hour and finally returns, causing Megan to nearly miss her flight to Denver. However, Drake accidentally puts Megan on the wrong flight, and she ends up en route to Los Angeles, California. They try to open the plane doors, but are caught and searched by the T.S.A. They attempt to call Megan's cell phone, but she has accidentally left it with Josh. Soon after, Drake and Josh decide to fly to L.A. to get her. Drake and Josh sit in separate seats, and as per usual, Drake gets better seating companions: women. Josh moves away from a disgusting family he sat next to and sits next to a criminal who has stolen a US Currency Printer. While their plane goes through turbulence, the fat lady Josh sat next to falls over on him. His G.O. (MP3 Player) is switched with the criminal's, who has stored blueprints for counterfeit money on it. Meanwhile, Megan calls for a limo in L.A. and arrives at the Chambrulay Hotel, a luxury hotel by the beach. Once Drake and Josh find that Megan is okay, the boys decide to stay in L.A. for a while. While Josh was in the bathroom, he meets an MTV producer, who is desperate for a new band to play for TRL tomorrow. Although Drake isn’t signed to a record label, Josh convinces the producer to hire Drake’s band. When the criminal and his accomplice confront Drake and Josh on the G.O's, the boys attempt to escape and are subsequently chased around the city in a stolen Viper which happens to be Tony Hawk's.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks which Army Group was the oldest.

If the summer is long enough and warm enough, all the snow may melt. This is what typically happens now. The earth was a little cooler 12,000 years ago. As a result, during the summer months, that amount of snow did not melt. It may have only been an inch or so of snow that melted. The following winter, snow fell on top of this left-over snow. This next winters snowfall had a head start. Year after year, the snow that did not melt became thicker and thicker. Inch by inch the snow started to build up.

In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: \\"n\\", the principal quantum number, ', the angular momentum quantum number, \\"m\\", the magnetic quantum number, and \\"m\\", the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their \\"n\\", ', and \\"m\\" values are the same, then their \\"m\\" must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spins of 1/2 and -1/2. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin-statistics theorem of 1940.\\n\\n- In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).\\n\\n- A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothingnot even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as lightcan escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.\\n\\n- A supernova is an astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. This causes the sudden appearance of a \\"new\\" bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months. \\n\\n- The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.\\n\\n- The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\\n\\n- Gravitational collapse is the contraction of an astronomical object due to the influence of its own gravity, which tends to draw matter inward toward the center of mass. Gravitational collapse is a fundamental mechanism for structure formation in the universe. Over time an initial relatively smooth distribution of matter will collapse to form pockets of higher density, typically creating a hierarchy of condensed structures such as clusters of galaxies, stellar groups, stars and planets.\\n\\n- A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.\\n\\n- A bipolar outflow represents two continuous flows of gas from the poles of a star. Bipolar outflows may be associated with protostars (young, forming stars), or with evolved post-AGB stars (often in the form of bipolar nebulae).\\n\\n- Vela X- 1 is a pulsing , eclipsing high - mass X-ray binary ( HMXB ) system , associated with the Uhuru source 4U 0900 - 40 and the supergiant star HD 77581 . The X-ray emission of the neutron star is caused by the capture and accretion of matter from the stellar wind of the supergiant companion . Vela X- 1 is the prototypical detached HMXB . The orbital period of the system is 8.964 days , with the neutron star being eclipsed for about two days of each orbit by HD 77581 . The spin period of the neutron star is about 283 seconds , and gives rise to strong X-ray pulsations . The mass of the pulsar is estimated to be at least 1.88 ± 0.13 solar masses .\\n\\n- A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.\\n\\n- X-ray binaries are a class of binary stars that are luminous in X-rays. \\nThe X-rays are produced by matter falling from one component, called the \\"donor\\" (usually a relatively normal star), to the other component, called the \\"accretor\\", which is very compact: a neutron star or black hole. \\nThe infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy, up to several tenths of its rest mass, as X-rays. The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation. (Hydrogen fusion releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass.)\\nAn estimated 10 positrons escape per second from a typical low-mass X-ray binary.\\n\\n- The positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1 \\"e\\", a spin of 1/2, and has the same mass as an electron. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, annihilation occurs, resulting in the production of two or more gamma ray photons (see electronpositron annihilation).\\n\\n- A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.\\n\\n- A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.\\n\\n- A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.\\n\\n- A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years.\\n\\n- The solar mass is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, equal to approximately 1.99 × 10 kilograms. It is used to indicate the masses of other stars, as well as clusters, nebulae and galaxies. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about two nonillion (two quintillion in the long scale) kilograms:\\n\\n- X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation.

The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it’s not) posting a page headlined, \\"\\"HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast.\\"\\" The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma.

There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage. \\"\\"Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds,\\"\\" wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth. As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path. \\"\\"Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ \\"\\" Williams wrote. \\"\\"After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today.\\"\\" While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson’s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975, amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric. Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. \\"\\"Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage,\\"\\" according to the National Hurricane Center. \\"\\"Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures.\\"\\" The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows: Category Sustained winds (mph) Types of damage 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur 5 157+ Catastrophic damage will occur The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010, the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge. Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated. From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology. A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models. The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however. The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures. \\"\\"Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,\\"\\" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. \\"\\"At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met.\\"\\" Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact. And the scale’s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, \\"\\"it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. … That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway.\\"\\" In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements. \\"\\"I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,\\"\\" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, \\"\\"did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm.\\"\\" Similarly, \\"\\"much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,\\"\\" Bell said. \\"\\"These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential.\\"\\" Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. \\"\\"Irma is a beast,\\"\\" she said. \\"\\"It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it.\\"\\" So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates .\\" Claim: Hurricane Irma could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast.","target":"0","rationale":"The paragraph states that the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which is used by the National Hurricane Center to categorize hurricanes, only goes up to 5.

Rama Rao became a mass hit. Important filmmakers were casting her and repeating her in their films. Filmmaker Vijay introduced her to Kannada cinema in his 1977 super-hit movie Sanadi Appanna alongside Kannada matinee idol Raj Kumar. The movie is also known to be the only movie to feature shehnai rendition by Ustad Bismillah Khan.

Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns.

Both Robert and Dale have farms that approximately the same size. Dale prefers to produce milk conventionally, as he likes the way that conventional milk tastes. Robert, on the other hand, decided to switch to organic milk production after reading an article online about it.\\n\\nHint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).","target":"Robert's","rationale":"According to the paragraph, Robert's decision to switch from conventional milk production (Dale’s method) to organic milk production was based on information he read online.

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected.

One example comes from agriculture. Food riots  and hunger make news, but the trend lying behind these matters is rarely talked about. This is the decline in the growth in yields of some of the world's major crops. A new study by the University of Minnesota and McGill University in Montreal looks at where, and how far, this decline is occurring.\\nThe authors take a vast number of data pointing for the four most important crops; rice, wheat, corn and soybeans. They find that on between 24 and 39% of all harvested areas, the improvement in yields that took place before the 1980s slowed down in the 1990s and 2000s.\\nThere are two worrying features of the slowdown. One is that it has been particularly sharp in the world's most populous  countries,India and China.\\nTheir ability to feed themselves has been an important source of relative stability both within the countries and on world food markets. That self-sufficiency cannot be taken for granted if yields continue to slow down or reverse.\\nSecond, yield growth has been lower in wheat and rice than in corn and soybeans. This is problematic because wheat and rice are more important as foods' accounting for around half of all calories consumed. Corn and soybeans are more important as feed grains. The authors note that we have preferentially focused our crop improvement efforts on feeding animals and cars rather than on crops that feed people and are the basis of food security in much of the world.\\nThe report qualifies the more optimistic findings of another new paper which suggests that the world will not have to dig up a lot more land for farming in order to feed 9 billion people in 2050, as the Food and Agriculture Organization has argued. Instead, it says, thanks to slowing population growth, land currently ploughed  up for crops might be able to _ to forest or wilderness. This could happen. The trouble is that the forecast assumes continued improvements in yields, which may not actually happen.\\nWhat does the author try to draw attention to?\\nA) Food riots and hunger in the world.\\nB) The decline of the grain yield growth.\\nC) News headlines in the leading media*\\nD) The food supply in populous countries.","target":"B","rationale":"The author is trying to draw attention to the decline in grain yield growth, which has serious implications for food security and population growth.

The name was possibly given after a local landmark—Akmola literally means \\"a white grave\\" in Kazakh language—although this theory is not universally accepted. In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named Akmolinsk. The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863 in an abstract from the Geographic and Statistical Dictionary of the Russian Empire. It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic centre to Kargaly in the East, Aktau fort in the South and through Atbasar to Kokshetau in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by Kenesary Khan, Akmolinsk fortress was burned. After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an uyezd town. During the rapid development of the Russian capitalist market, the huge Saryarka — Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan were actively exploited by the colonial administration. To draft regulation governing the Kazakh Steppe the Government of the Russian Empire formed Steppe Commission in 1865.

In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the centre of the newly established Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire).

In the course of the first 30 years of its existence, the population of Akmola numbered a trifle more than 2,000 people. However, over the next 30 years the citys population increased by three times according to volosts and Human settlement of the Akmolinsk Oblast.

Although neither exogenously added calmodulin (up to 10 micrograms/ml) nor calcium (from 10(-7)-10(-5) M) stimulated enzyme activity, calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W7, and W13 inhibited it.

Several Danish guidelines on antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections in general practice have been issued to promote rational prescribing of antibiotics, however it is unclear if these recommendations are followed. We aimed to characterise the pattern of antibiotic prescriptions for patients diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infections, by means of electronic prescriptions, labeled with clinical indications, from Danish general practice. Acute respiratory tract infections accounted for 456,532 antibiotic prescriptions issued between July 2012 and June 2013. Pneumonia was the most common indication with 178,354 prescriptions (39%), followed by acute tonsillitis (21%) and acute otitis media (19%). In total, penicillin V accounted for 58% of all prescriptions, followed by macrolides (18%) and amoxicillin (15%). The use of second-line agents increased with age for all indications, and comprised more than 40% of the prescriptions in patients aged >75 years. Women were more often prescribed antibiotics regardless of clinical indication. This is the first Danish study to characterise antibiotic prescription patterns for acute respiratory tract infections by data linkage of clinical indications. The findings confirm that penicillin V is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic agent for treatment of patients with an acute respiratory tract infection in Danish general practice. However, second-line agents like macrolides and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid are overused. Strategies to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing especially for pneumonia, acute otitis media and acute rhinosinusitis are warranted.    RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS TRACKING THE OVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS: Better adherence to guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for different respiratory tract infections are warranted in Danish general practice. The over-use of antibiotics, particularly so-called 'second-line' agents such as amoxicillin, increases resistance and may lead to a potentially catastrophic scenario where antibiotics are no longer effective. Exactly how widespread the over-use of antibiotics is for different infections, however, is not clear. Rune Aabenhus at the University of Copenhagen and co-workers analyzed primary care data regarding antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections including pneumonia and ear infections in Denmark. They found that penicillin V-the current recommended first-line drug in Scandinavian countries-accounted for 58 per cent of prescriptions, a figure which should be improved. Amoxicillin and macrolides were over-prescribed, particularly in elderly patients. The team also call for further analysis of prescriptions given by out-of-hours clinics.","target":"Characterisation of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections in Danish general practice: a retrospective registry based cohort study","rationale":"The title should briefly describe the research topic and highlight the key findings.

This three-compartment model provides a rational estimate of the fraction of walking's metabolic cost that powers the actual walking movement. Doubt is expressed that \\"comfortable speed of walking\\" is definable in energy terms.

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist.\\n\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966. She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972.

Zumwalt, Jr.  After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.

Passage 1:After leaving the Academy, German continued to teach at Wimbledon School and to play the violin in orchestras at various London theatres, including the Savoy. In 1888, an introduction by conductor Alberto Randegger to theatre manager Richard Mansfield led to German's appointment as conductor and musical director at the Globe Theatre in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing incidental music for the theatre's lavish productions, starting with Richard III in 1889. This music was well received (The Times called for a concert suite to be arranged), and the overture soon became popular in concert halls. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of Henry Irving's version of Henry VIII at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play's score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included Henry Arthur Jones's The Tempter in 1893, Johnston Forbes-Robertson's Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum in 1895, Herbert Beerbohm Tree's productions of As You Like It (1896) and Much Ado about Nothing (1898), and Anthony Hope's English Nell (later known as Nell Gwynn) in 1900, starring Marie Tempest.\\n Passage 2:The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is one of the largest salamanders and one of the largest amphibians in the world.

On farms in central China, it is extensively farmed and sometimes bred, although many of the salamanders on the farms are caught in the wild. It has been listed as one of the top-10 \\"focal species\\" in 2008 by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project. The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a \\"living fossil\\". Although protected under Chinese law and CITES Appendix I, the wild population has declined by more than an estimated 80% since the 1950s. Although traditionally recognized as one of two living species of Andrias salamander in Asia, the other being the Japanese giant salamander, evidence indicates that the Chinese giant salamander may be composed of at least five cryptic species, further compounding each individual species' endangerment.\\n Passage 3:In 1962, the Belgian mandate of Ruanda-Urundi received independence, creating the Republic of Rwanda and the Kingdom of Burundi. Both states had traditionally had monarchies dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group over a Hutu ethnic majority but Rwanda's monarchy was abolished by a political revolution in 1959-61. In the first years of independence, Burundi seemed to have achieved a balance between ethnic groups which brought members of the different ethnic groups into government, moderated in part by the mwami (king) Mwambutsa IV who was popular with all groups but was himself Tutsi. Both Tutsi, Hutu and Ganwa were part of the dominant political party, the Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progrès national, UPRONA). In October 1961, shortly before the date scheduled for independence, the Burundian Prime Minister Prince Louis Rwagasore was assassinated, raising ethnic tensions in the country. After a period of rule by Tutsi prime ministers, Mwambutsa appointed Burundi's first Hutu leader, Pierre Ngendandumwe, but Ngendandumwe was assassinated in January 1965 by a Rwandan Tutsi. Elections held in May 1965 took place in an atmosphere of strong ethnic tension. Hutu candidates gained a majority, but Mwambutsa deposed the Hutu Prime Minister Joseph Bamina and instead installed a Tutsi candidate, Léopold Biha, in October 1965.","target":"3","rationale":"The correct answer is Passage 3 since it provides information on the capital of Ruanda-Urundi."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true.

Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. The first disembarkation of Italian troops occurred on October 10. The Italian contingent of 20,000 troops was deemed sufficient to accomplish the conquest at the time. Tobruk, Derna and Khoms were easily conquered, but the same was not true for Benghazi. The first true setback for the Italian troops happened on October 23, when poor placement of the troops near Tripoli led them to be almost completely encircled by more mobile Arab cavalry, backed by some Turkish regular units. The attack was portrayed as a simple revolt by the Italian press, but it nearly annihilated much of the small Italian expeditionary corps. The corps was consequently enlarged to 100,000 men who had to face 20,000 Arabs and 8,000 Turks. The war turned into one of position.  Even some of the earliest examples of utilisation in modern warfare of armoured cars and air power by the Italian forces had little effect on the initial outcome. However, the war was notable for the first military use of heavier-than-air craft. Capitano Carlo Piazza flew the first military reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.\\n\\n- The true parrots are about 350 species of colorful flighted (with a few notable exceptions) hook-billed, mostly herbivorous birds forming the superfamily Psittacoidea, one of the three superfamilies in the biological order Psittaciformes (parrots). True parrots are widespread, with species in Mexico, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and eastwards across the Pacific Ocean as far as Polynesia. The true parrots include many of the familiar parrots including macaws, conures, lorikeets, eclectus, amazon parrots, African gray parrot.\\n\\n- A cockatoo is a parrot that is any of the 21 species belonging to the bird family Cacatuidae, the only family in the superfamily Cacatuoidea. Along with the Psittacoidea (true parrots) and the Strigopoidea (large New Zealand parrots), they make up the order Psittaciformes (parrots). The family has a mainly Australasian distribution, ranging from the Philippines and the eastern Indonesian islands of Wallacea to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Australia. \\n\\n- Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.\\n\\n- The family Psittacidae is one of three families of true parrots, and consists of two subfamilies, the Old World or Afrotropical parrots of Psittacinae) and the New World or Neotropical parrots of Arinae. The family numbers approximately 10 species in the Old World, and 148 species in the New World, and included several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries. Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-gold macaw among the New World parrots and the African grey parrot among the Old World parrots. These parrots are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa and the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Two parrots, one extinct, formerly inhabited North America.\\n\\n- Psittacinae is a subfamily of Afrotropical or Old World parrots; the eleven species are found in two genera. Among the species is the iconic African grey parrot. These parrots are native to sub-Saharan Africa, the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.\\n\\n- Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world.\\n\\n- Parrots, also known as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 393 species in 92 genera that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (\\"true\\" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.\\n\\n- In biogeography, a pantropical (\\"across the tropics\\") distribution is one which covers tropical regions of all continents.

He then visited the same location a year later, and found that the place was facing a severe drought. He marked it as time B.\\n\\nWould time B see less or more wildfires than time A?\\n\\nHint: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster.

Pituitary glands from both sexes at different ages were monodispersed with 0.1% trypsin. Freshly dispersed cells were incubated in Cunningham chambers for measurement of the fraction of plaque-forming cells and the size of plaques formed, or attached to glass slides for measurement of the fraction of cells staining for PRL by ICC. The percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5% of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54% in the females at proestrus and about 37% in the males. Sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter. The mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1,100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15,600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6,700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age; then fell to the adult levels of about 5,500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3,200 microns 2 in males. Sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent. The results from ICC closely matched those from the plaque assay, except at 5 days of age and in the adult males. At 5 days, the fraction of cells staining for PRL was twice that of cells forming plaques. In adult male rats there were about 47% immunostained PRL cells but only about 39% plaque-forming cells. This difference, however, disappeared after estrogen treatment. These results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent.","target":"Age Factors","rationale":"The abstract discusses the developmental changes and sexual differences in the lactotrope population, which are dependent on both age and estrogens.

The club was founded in 1876 and played their first few matches at Sophia Gardens, but soon relocated to Cardiff Arms Park where they have been based ever since. They built a reputation as one of the great clubs in world rugby largely through a series of wins against international touring sides.\\n\\nWith professionalism dawned a new era at Cardiff RFC. It allowed them to sign legendary outside-half Jonathan Davies back from rugby league, and another major change was that there would be a European Cup, sponsored by Heineken, containing teams from France, Ireland, Wales, Italy and Romania (England and Scotland did not join for another year). Cardiff progressed to the knock-out stages in November by drawing with Bordeaux-Begles and beating Ulster. December saw the end of the Alex Evans era, as he departed to return home to Australia. Terry Holmes took charge of the club, and in his first full match the Blue and Blacks beat Leinster away to progress to the first Heineken Cup final. The game was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of a crowd of 21,800, where despite 18 points from the boot of Adrian Davies, Cardiff were beaten 21-18 by Toulouse after extra time.  Cardiff, despite not losing a league game under Holmes, were runners-up on the domestic front as well, finishing level with Neath on points but coming second on try count. After the end of the 95-96 season Peter Thomas invested money into the club allowing them to sign Rob Howley, Dai Young back from rugby league, Leigh Davies, Gwyn Jones and Justin Thomas for the cost of around PS2million. Internationals Mark Ring, Steven Blackmore and the half-backs that had started the Heineken Cup final, Andy Moore and Adrian Davies all departed.  Despite all the new signings, Cardiff lost their first three games of the season, and the 1996/97 season was in many respects worse than the year before - Cardiff were knocked out in the Heineken Cup semi-finals by eventual champions Brive, and in the Welsh Premier Division they fell to third, behind champions Pontypridd and Llanelli. However, after Alex Evans returned to head up the coaching team, that season did lead to some silverware, as Cardiff beat Llanelli 36-26 in the semi-final and Swansea 33-26 in the final of the SWALEC Cup. Grzegorz Kacala and Tony Rees, both forwards part of the Brive team that knocked Cardiff out of the Heineken Cup and went on to win it, were signed for 1997/98 along with Wales internationals Steve Williams and Spencer John (Gareth Thomas also arrived in December from Bridgend).  Despite Cardiff's difficulties, compounded by those of the national team, Howley and Young were both chosen to go on 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Howley had to return home early due to injury and neither of the two Cardiff players started a Test match.  In the 1997/98 season, Cardiff were Wales's sole representative in the quarter finals of the Heineken Cup, and were beaten away in rematch of the previous year's quarter-final, by Bath, who would go on to win the tournament. However, their domestic cup campaign ended before the quarter final stage, losing 24-9 to Ebbw Vale, and they finished runners up to Swansea in the League. Following this season, Alex Evans left Cardiff for Australia for the second time and Terry Holmes was put back in charge.\\n\\nwhy did they sign him back?","target":"professionalism","rationale":"The text states that the dawn of professionalism allowed Cardiff to sign Jonathan Davies back from rugby league.

For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors.

One report, on 2,000 Danish children studying Swedish, concluded that the teenagers learned more, in less time, than the younger children. Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood.\\nThere are several possible explanations for these findings. For one thing, adults know more about the world and therefore are able to understand meanings more easily than children. Moreover, adults can use logical  thinking to help themselves see patterns in the language. Finally, adults have more self-discipline (self-control) than children.\\nAll in all, it seems that the common idea that children are better language learners than adults may not be a fact, but a myth.\\nQuestion: According to the passage, teenagers can learn a foreign language   _   than younger children.\\nOptions: A: harder\\nB: more efficiently\\nC: more slowly\\nD: more carefully","target":"B","rationale":"The passage suggests that teenagers learn languages more efficiently than younger children, making B the correct answer.

It traditionally marks the turning point of the spring classics, with the climbers and stage racers replacing the cobbled classics riders as the favourites.\\n\\n- An individual time trial (ITT) is a road bicycle race in which cyclists race alone against the clock on flat or rolling terrain, or up a mountain road such as Alpe d'Huez (in French: \\"contre la montre\\"  literally \\"against the watch\\", in Italian: \\"tappa a cronometro\\" \\"stopwatch stage\\"). There are also track-based time trials where riders compete in velodromes, and team time trials (TTT). ITTs are also referred to as \\"the race of truth\\", as winning depends only on each rider's strength and endurance, and not on help provided by team-mates and others riding ahead and creating a slipstream. The opening stage of stage race will often be a short individual time trial called a prologue.\\n\\n- The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.\\n\\n- Francesco Conconi (born 19 April 1935 in Como, Italy) is an Italian sports doctor and scientist, with disciples such as Michele Ferrari and Luigi Cecchini.\\n\\n- Michele Ferrari (born 26 March 1953) is an Italian physician, cycling coach and author.

For many years he was the owner and later manager of Russian UCI WorldTeam . Other career highlights include placing first in the Amstel Gold Race in 1997, multiple Danish National Championships, and stage wins in the Giro d'Italia. On 25 May 2007, he admitted that he placed first in the Tour de France using banned substances, and he was no longer considered the winner by the Tour's organizers. In July 2008, the Tour reconfirmed his victory but with an asterisk label to indicate his doping offences.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Road racing is the most popular professional form of bicycle racing, in terms of numbers of competitors, events and spectators. Races can typically be split into 'mass-start' events where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a handicap), racing to set finish point, or individual and team time trials where riders or teams race a course individually against the clock.\\n\\n- The Giro d'Italia (aka Corsa Rosa or Giro) is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper \\"La Gazzetta dello Sport\\"; however it is currently run by RCS Sport. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI Proteams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers can invite.\\n\\n- The 1996 Tour de France was the 83rd edition of the Tour de France, starting on 29 June and ending on 21 July, featuring 19 regular stages, 2 individual time trials, a prologue and a rest day (10 July).

Its western border lies east of Rome. The region is divided into the four provinces of L'Aquila, Teramo, Pescara, and Chieti. Abruzzo borders the region of Marche to the north, Lazio to the west and south-west, Molise to the south-east, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Geographically, Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area to the west, which includes the Gran Sasso D'italia, and a coastal area to the east with beaches on the Adriatic sea. Abruzzo is considered culturally, linguistically, and historically a region of Southern Italy, although geographically it may also be considered central. The Italian Statistical Authority (ISTAT) deems it to be part of Southern Italy, partially because of Abruzzo's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\\n\\n- The Gulf of Taranto (Italian: \\"Golfo di Taranto\\", Latin: \\"Sinus Tarentinus\\") is a gulf of the Ionian Sea, in Southern Italy.\\n\\n- The Tyrrhenian Sea (, , , ) is part of the Mediterranean Sea off the western coast of Italy.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Philippe de Vitry (31 October 1291  9 June 1361) was a French composer, music theorist and poet. He was an accomplished, innovative, and influential composer, and may also have been the author of the \\"Ars Nova\\" treatise. He was widely acknowledged as the greatest musician of his day, with Petrarch writing a glowing tribute, calling him: \\"... the keenest and most ardent seeker of truth, so great a philosopher of our age.\\"\\n\\n- Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300  April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Francesco degli Organi, Francesco il Cieco, or Francesco da Firenze, called by later generations Francesco Landini or Landino (c. 1325 or 1335  September 2, 1397) was an Italian composer, organist, singer, poet and instrument maker. He was one of the most famous and revered composers of the second half of the 14th century, and by far the most famous composer in Italy.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- Ars nova (Latin for new art) refers to a musical style which flourished in France and the Burgundian Low Countries in the Late Middle Ages: more particularly, in the period between the preparation of the \\"Roman de Fauvel\\" (1310s) and the death of the composer Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The term is sometimes used more generally to refer to all European polyphonic music of the 14th century. For instance, \\"Italian ars nova\\" is sometimes used to denote the music of Francesco Landini and his compatriots (although Trecento music is the more common term for music in Italy). The \\"ars\\" in \\"ars nova\\" can be read as \\"technique\\", or \\"style\\". The term was first used in two musical treatises, titled \\"Ars novae musicae\\" (New Technique of Music) (c. 1320) by Johannes de Muris, and a collection of writings (c. 1322) attributed to Philippe de Vitry often simply called \\"Ars nova\\" today. However, the term was only first used to describe an historical era by Johannes Wolf in 1904.\\n\\n- The Roman de Fauvel is a 14th-century French allegorical verse romance of satirical bent, generally attributed to Gervais du Bus, a clerk at the French royal chancery. The original narrative of 3,280 octosyllabics is divided into two books, dated to 1310 and 1314 respectively. In 13167 Chaillou de Pesstain produced a greatly expanded version.\\n\\n- Johannes de Muris ( c.1290 - c.1355 ) was a French philosopher , astronomer , mathematician , and music theorist best known for treatises on the ars nova , titled Ars nove musice . Life For a medieval person primarily known through his scholarly writing , it is highly unusual that Johannes de Muris '' life can be traced enough to form a decently consistent biography . Born in Normandy , he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France . The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7 , 1310 , which Muris was allegedly a part of . Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime , suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s . He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment . The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment . By 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in Evreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris . An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the Collège de Sorbonne until around 1325 . During this time it is believed that he travelled freely , making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321 . However , the double monastery of Fontevrault ( Maine0et - Loire ) was where he settled in March 1326 . He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to Evreux . Financial records in Muris '' own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year . In 1342 he was one of six cannons of the collegiate church in Mézières - en - Brenne . In 1344 , he was invited to Avignon by Pope Clement VI to participate in the calendar reform . The final date associated to Muris is 1345 in conjunction with the reforms that took place in Avignon .
