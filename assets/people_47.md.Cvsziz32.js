Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \\n\\n- LeAnne Howe ( born April 29 , 1951 ) is an American author and Eidson Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at the University of Georgia , Athens .

About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs.

Passage:Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted by biologists but natural selection was denied, including but not limited to the late 19th century eclipse of Darwinism, alternative scientific explanations such as Lamarckism, orthogenesis, structuralism, catastrophism, vitalism and theistic evolution were entertained, not necessarily separately. (Purely religious points of view such as young or old earth creationism or intelligent design are not considered here.) Different factors motivated people to propose non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for teleology or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some of these scientists and philosophers, like St. George Jackson Mivart and Charles Lyell, who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others, such as the biologist and philosopher Herbert Spencer, the botanist George Henslow (son of Darwin's mentor John Stevens Henslow, also a botanist), and the author Samuel Butler, felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks for the fields of study of two scientists, but only mentions one scientist by name.

As the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and Hildegard , he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father 's death in 814 , a position which he held until his death , save for the period 833 -- 34 , during which he was deposed . During his reign in Aquitaine , Louis was charged with the defence of the empire 's southwestern frontier . He conquered Barcelona from the Muslims in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over Pamplona and the Basques south of the Pyrenees in 812 . As emperor he included his adult sons , Lothair , Pepin , and Louis , in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them . The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments , notably the brutal treatment of his nephew Bernard of Italy , for which Louis atoned in a public act of self - debasement . In the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons , only exacerbated by Louis 's attempts to include his son Charles by his second wife in the succession plans . Though his reign ended on a high note , with order largely restored to his empire , it was followed by three years of civil war . Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father , though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort .\\n\\n- Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.\\n\\n- Aquitaine ( Poitevin-Saintongeais : \\"Aguiéne\\"), archaic \\"Guyenne\\"/\\"Guienne\\" (Occitan: \\"Guiana\\") was a traditional region of France, and was an administrative region of France until 1 January 2016. It is now part of the new region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It is situated in the south-western part of Metropolitan France, along the Atlantic Ocean and the Pyrenees mountain range on the border with Spain. It is composed of the five departments of Dordogne, Lot-et-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Landes and Gironde. In the Middle Ages, Aquitaine was a kingdom and a duchy, whose boundaries fluctuated considerably.\\n\\n- In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.\\n\\n- The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.\\n\\n- The Fall of the Western Roman Empire (also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Emperor, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from \\"barbarians\\" outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'position held' with the subject 'louis the pious'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- emperor\\n - holy roman emperor\\n - king\\n - king of italy\\n - pope\\n - ruler\\n - senate\\n - sovereign","target":"holy roman emperor","rationale":"The question asks: \\"What object entity has the relation of 'position held' with the subject 'louis the pious'? \\nIn this context, an example of a position is \\"\\"holy roman emperor\\"\\", and Louis shared that title with his father Charlemagne.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

Passage:Payton's big break came when she was cast as Harriet Winslow, the elevator operator on the ABC sitcom 'Perfect Strangers in 1987. Her performance was so well received by audiences that she was given her own sitcom, Family Matters, in 1989. Continuing her character Harriette Winslow from Perfect Strangers, she played a mother in an African-American middle-class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Payton left Family Matters partway through its final season, appearing for the last time on December 19, 1997. Payton's character was played by Judyann Elder in the show's remaining eight episodes. In 2002, Payton appeared on the \\"TV Moms\\" episode of the Anne Robinson version of The Weakest Link, and was the third one voted off. In 2003, Payton and her daughter appeared on a Mother's Day episode of Lingo, playing against fellow TV mom Meredith Baxter and her daughter. Baxter and her daughter won. In 2005, Jo Marie Payton provided the voice of Suga Mama in The Proud Family Movie. Her other television credits include Desperate Housewives, Reba, Girlfriends, Wanda at Large, Judging Amy, The Parkers, Will & Grace, The Hughleys, 7th Heaven, Moesha, The Jamie Foxx Show, 227, Silver Spoons, Small Wonder and The New Odd Couple. She also appeared in the Canadian TV mini series The Rev as Mama. In 2005, Payton co-hosted the 15th Annual NAACP Theatre Awards with Glynn Turman.

As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcome of respiratory viruses in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, include patients aged between 0 and 18 who fulfilled Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HAP. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. All included patients were monitored until discharge to collect data on the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. All-cause 30-day mortality was also ascertained. Results: Four thousand three hundred twenty-seven patients were followed for 42,658 patient-days and 5,150 ventilator-days. Eighty-eight patients (2.03%) met the CDC criteria for HAP, 63 patients were included, and clinical and epidemiological characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between patients with virus associated healthcare-associated pneumonia (VAHAP) and those with non-viral healthcare-associated pneumonia (NVHAP). At least one respiratory virus was detected in 65% [95% CI (53-77)] of episodes of HAP, with a single viral pathogen observed in 53.9% and coinfection with 2 viruses in 11.1% of cases. The outcome in terms of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and the 30-day mortality did not show a significant difference between groups. Conclusions: In two-thirds of the patients a respiratory virus was identified. There was no difference in mortality or the rest of the clinical outcome variables. About half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, which emphasizes the importance of considering these pathogens in nosocomial infections, since their identification can influence the decrease in hospital costs and be taken into account in infection control policies.","target":"Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia: Don't Forget About Respiratory Viruses!","rationale":"The title should include a statement about the fact that respiratory viruses were detected in about 2/3 of cases of HAP and it should emphasize the importance of considering these pathogens in nosocomial infections.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.

All patients underwent bone biopsies. Histomorphometry of static and dynamic parameters of bone structure, bone formation and resorption, and quantitation of stainable bone aluminum at the osteoid-bone interface were performed. In addition, bone aluminum content was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Bone aluminum content was elevated in all patients (81 +/- 9.6 vs. 18 +/- 6 micrograms/g dry wt) and stainable aluminum was found in 47% of them. All patients with predominant low-turnover osteomalacia or adynamic bone disease displayed stainable bone aluminum. In contrast, stainable bone aluminum was not present in individuals with predominant-hyperparathyroid bone disease. Patients with stainable aluminum had lower bone mass (P less than 0.05), higher volume and surface of lamellar osteoid (P less than 0.01), less volume and surface of woven osteoid (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01), lower osteoblastic and osteoclastic indices (P less than 0.01), less doubly labelled osteoid seams, lower mineral apposition rate and lower bone formation rates (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01). Stainable aluminum correlated with volume of lamellar osteoid and cellular parameters of bone formation and resorption, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rates (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.001). In contrast, bone aluminum content correlated with volume of lamellar osteoid only (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that stainable aluminum at the mineralization front and not aluminum content of bone reflects the histopathologic changes found in bone of dialyzed patients.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract states that the study evaluated stainable bone aluminum and measured bone aluminum content in 55 patients on chronic maintenance dialysis.

Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to St. Thomas, Nevada, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:\\nWe are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown. Our boats, tied to a common stake, are chafing each other, as they are tossed by the fretful river. They ride high and buoyant, for their loads are lighter than we could desire. We have but a month's rations remaining. The flour has been re-sifted through the mosquito net sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun, and re-shrunken to their normal bulk; the sugar has all melted, and gone on its way down the river; but we have a large sack of coffee. The lighting of the boats has this advantage: they will ride the waves better, and we shall have little to carry when we make a portage.\\nWe are three-quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth, and the great river shrinks into insignificance, as it dashes its angry waves against the walls and cliffs, that rise to the world above; they are but puny ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and down the sands, or lost among the boulders.\\nWe have an unknown distance yet to run; an unknown river yet to explore....","target":"apples","rationale":"The narrator mentions that they have some dried apples, and after detailing how the party had to reduce their food supply due to its weight in order for them to continue exploring down the river, he writes:\\n\\"the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun, and re-shrunken to their normal bulk...\\". \\nThis means that before setting off on the expedition again, these dehydrated apples were made plump by being left out in direct sunlight.

Passage:Mohammad Parvin began his career at the Persepolis youth academy in Tehran before signing his first pro contract in 2005. Despite the fact that his father was the head coach of the team, he remained unused until making his debut in a friendly match against German giants Bayern Munich. Being dubbed as a future star player in the national team, his time at Persepolis turned difficult following his fathers departure as a coach. He later followed his Parvin senior, who had become technical director of Steel Azin, and became the top scorer in the first division. Following a remarkable season in a star-studded second tier side, he chose to move soon, again shortly after his fathers resignation. Despite reportedly being offered a contract by Persepolis, he moved to Saipa. It was speculated that the reason for his refusal to play at Persepolis was the troublesome relationship between Dariush Mostafavi (then Club CEO at Persepolis) and his father Ali Parvin. After only 12 performances at Saipa, he spent 6 successful months on loan at Dunajská Streda in Europe only to return to his beloved Persepolis in July 2009.

The line was the third commercially operated magnetic levitation line to open in history. It is the fastest commercial high-speed electric train in the world. The train line was designed to connect Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of central Pudong where passengers could interchange to the Shanghai Metro to continue their trip to the city center. It cost $1.2 billion to build. The line's balance of payments has been in huge deficit since its opening. From 2004 to 2006, Shanghai Meglev Transportation Development Co.,Ltd, the company runs the line, had more than 1 billion RMB in losses.\\nThe line is not a part of the Shanghai Metro network, which operates its own service to Pudong Airport from central Shanghai and from Longyang Road Station.\\n\\n- The Beijing Subway is a rapid transit rail network that serves the urban and suburban districts of Beijing municipality.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.

Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\\\\n\\\\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.

I'm there to get an A and the credit, don't quite give a shit about going above and beyond. The classes I actually care about I put in genuine time and effort into, and actually learn something useful. English is not one such class, especially when it involves old literature that curriculums still administer. I'm taking AP Literature this year not because I give a damn about literature, but because I want the AP credit to pad my transcript and make college easier later on. The class, as I expected, is extremely boring and honestly hasn't taught me anything of value since starting. We've spent 3 weeks just reading through the intricacies of Hamlet, which I spent napping or playing on my phone. In the end, we didn't even do much with Hamlet, a short 30 question quiz and a couple of questions on the unit test. At this point, all the shits I've given about the class as a whole has gone down the drain, I bs all the assignments that are given and I do just fine. I have better things to spend my time on, so all things related to AP Literature are punted to the bottom of my priority list of stuff I do every day. I do my best to keep that list short, and normally English is the last thing I want to add to it. \\n\\nThis leads to what happened today, right before class I check the calendar outside next to the door and see that we have another quiz coming up this Friday that I have to study for. I let out an audible sigh and sound of disgust in a semi-joking fashion, I already had plenty of shit lined up from other classes I needed to do. Apparently my English teacher, we'll call her Mrs. D, heard me and got very triggered. At first, I thought she was joking when she said something to the effect of \\"trust me I don't want to be here either\\". About 5 minutes later in class, she walked out and called for me to come out as well. I don't remember the whole following conversation very well, but I remember a few select words she used. She said I was rude and had a superiority complex, claiming that I thought I was better than everyone else in the class. Adding on that I am also the most obnoxious person in the class, that I don't contribute to group/partner assignments, and I don't stay engaged with everything. \\n\\nWhat she said does have some merit, so I'll provide two perspectives to see this situation from, mine and Mrs. D's.\\n\\nMrs. D is absolutely horrendous at teaching and her class provides no academic value to me besides the credit and grade. She doesn't actually teach anything, we just pile through book after book and story after story without learning anything useful. A majority of her assignments are almost completely redundant: a 4-page personal journal every two weeks, a random literary term quiz here and there, and multiple-choice problems that are loosely tied to what we read that she never explains. I've stopped giving a shit and normally catch up on much-needed sleep or scroll through Reddit on my phone to stave off boredom during long reading times. I do carry my weight whenever I need to, and contrary to her claim, I also contribute to group and partner activities. I do the assignments given, usually with full marks. I'm not doing badly in the class, floating at a 97 with a couple pending grades that may drop it a point or two. \\n\\nFrom Mrs. D's perspective, I'm a lazy student who doesn't care about her class, which is wholly true. I play on my phone or fall asleep during reading times, and have no respect for the sparing assignments she does give the class. I'm not engaged with everything she discusses and I bullshit everything. I openly showed my disgust to her stuff and barely gave her my minimum level of respect. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've never been so shaken in a conversation with a teacher in a long time, I'm generally on good terms with all of my other teachers, even becoming a teacher's assistant for one and a class ambassador with another. At the end of the class, I cratered and offered a sincere apology for my apparently shitty behavior. I was genuinely sorry in some aspects, but mostly I just wanted to end any potential animosity that lingers and take a morally commendable route. \\n\\nSo the question remains, am I the asshole?

The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. \\nIn its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. \\nAfter a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album.

In 1997, Maskhadov signed a decree putting Barayev and his Special Purpose Islamic Regiment under the command of the Chechen interior ministry. Barayev, who also held the post of deputy commander of the National Guards, however refused to obey the order. When six of his men were detained in Ingushetia, Barayev attacked an Ingush police post and took hostages; one of them was killed and the rest were prisoner-swapped. Two more of his men were captured in Chechnya and made to confess to kidnappings on the state TV. His militia and some Islamist allies from Shariah Security forces fought with the Chechen government forces in a large-scale gun battle in the city of Gudermes in the summer of 1998. Between 50 and around 80 people were killed in the mutiny. The SPIR was not disarmed, but Barayev was stripped of his rank of Brigade General and declared as the \\"enemy of Ichkeria and the Chechen people\\". In December 1998, Barayev proclaimed the Supreme Council of Islamic Jamaats, dug trenches around Urus-Martan and threatened to attack targets across and outside of Chechnya if Maskhadov tried to fight them.  A commonly accusation against Barayev regarded the late 1998 abduction and beheading of four foreign mobile phone engineers. It was claimed that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) outbid the employers of kidnapped British engineers to get them decapitated by Barayev and his gang rather than be released; supposedly, the video and photographic materials of their executions fed the FSB anti-western propaganda efforts at beginning of Second Chechen War.  A former Russian hostage Abdurakhman Adukhov told the BBC that Barayev told him it was actually Osama bin Laden who paid him $30m for the atrocity, outbidding the ransom offer of $10m. Barayev himself denied that his group kidnapped and killed the foreigners.

In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ).

The device uses lasers to identify explosive materials in gases in the air.

Our results suggest that changes in the passive mechanical properties of the upper limb affected by Parkinsonian rigidity may have taken place, accounting for the more flexed neutral elbow angle and greater passive stiffness. Using this technique, response to antirigidity therapy and natural progression of illness can be quantitatively assessed and followed. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The study presents numerical values that are relevant to the research being described.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War.\\nThe site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley.\\nThe terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded.\\nThe name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.

The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.

I’m not like a god or anything but I really enjoy it and have put a decent amount of time into improving my play. \\n\\nSo when FakeName suggested put some skin in the game, I happily agreed. It wasn’t anything crazy, just whoever wins gets a drink from the loser. He won the first game, and we upped the prize pool to two drinks. We went back and forth like this for a few games (1 on 1 they lasted 10-20 minutes each). \\n\\nEventually I started to pull away. FakeName is very new to the game, and he was making all the amateur mistakes. He only bet when he felt good about his hand, and he called my bets way too much when he was “just hoping for that one card to come out!” He had some physical tells too- big eyes when his card came, fingering his chips when he just couldn’t wait to bet. In other words- very easy to exploit. \\n\\nThis is where I feel bad. Instead of stopping while I was marginally ahead (2-3 drinks), I said yes when he asked the chance to go double or nothing. I won. I said I was willing to let him go double or nothing until he won or we was ready to stop; before we know it, an hour has gone by and he’s down 40 drinks. Yeah, 40. That’s like $200 and waaay more than we should have been wagering given our stations in life. \\n\\nWhat makes it worse is that we had joked earlier that we were both the kind of people who couldn’t give up on a bad thing- that if we found ourselves in a hole we had the tendency to dig ourselves deeper trying to get out. Then two hours later the exact thing has happened to him, with me knowingly profiting off of his bad decisions. \\n\\nI know FakeName is a grown adult and he hopefully learned a good lesson, but I can’t help but feel like I should have kept it from getting to where it did.

The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.\\n\\n- Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).\\n\\n- Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.\\n\\n- Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).\\n\\n- Cross-country skiing is a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own locomotion to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practised as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.\\n\\n- The Holmenkollen Ski Festival ( Norwegian : Holmenkollen skifestival or Holmenkollrennene ) is a traditional annual Nordic skiing event in Holmenkollen , Oslo , Norway . The full official name of the event is Holmenkollen FIS World Cup Nordic .\\n\\n- A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski.\\n\\n- Telemark skiing is a skiing technique that combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing. Telemark skiing is named after the Telemark region of Norway, where the discipline originated. Sondre Norheim is often credited for first demonstrating the turn in ski races, which included cross country, slalom and jumping, in Norway around 1868. Sondre Norheim also experimented with ski and binding design, introducing side cuts to skis and heel bindings (like a cable).\\n\\n- Holmenkollbakken is a large ski jumping hill located at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway.

To the north, the area borders to the woodlands area Marka.\\n\\n- A ski jumping hill is a sports venue used for ski jumping. They vary in size from temporary handmade snow structures to permanent competition venues. At the top is an in-run where the jumper runs down to generate sufficient speed, before reaching the jump. The skier is then airborne until landing on the landing slope. The last part of the hill is the out-run, which may be either flat or even uphill, allowing the jumper to stop. The steepest point of the hill is the construction point, which is used to determine the score of a particular length. The size of a hill is measured in the hill size. Hills with a hill size exceeding HS185 are designated ski flying hills; there are five such hills in the world.\\n\\n- Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel.

By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum.\\n\\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.  Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.  Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What else was important about Chicago's later years?","target":"the Feminist Studio Workshop,","rationale":"The context states that Chicago co-founded the Feminist Studio Workshop, a space where women can discuss their life experiences and influence each other's art.\\n\\"\\"Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\"\\"\\nThus, it might be inferred that this was an important event in Chicago's later years because she wanted to create spaces for collaboration between feminist artists."},{"source":"As time goes by, sports have become more and more important in people's modern life.

After they come together, they will develop into a human being. How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells? Keep reading to find out. Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together. This is called fertilization. Sperm are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse. They swim through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure 1.1). If the sperm breaks through the eggs membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth. The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times. It forms a hollow ball of cells. After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side of the uterus. This is called implantation. It usually happens about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl.","target":"how do eggs develop?","rationale":"There are 2 ways to answer this question: \\"how do eggs develop?\\" and \\"how does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells?\\".

MATERIALS AND METHODS During 1996-98, 563 suicide attempts were studied in a general hospital in Madrid (Spain). Medication overdose was used in 456 suicide attempts (81%). The ratio between dose taken and maximum prescription dose recommended was used to evaluate the medication toxicity.   \\n RESULTS Benzodiazepines were the drugs most often used in self-poisoning (65% of overdoses), followed by new antidepressants (11%), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (10%), and antipsychotics (8%). An overdose with any of the three latter psychiatric medications was significantly more frequent in patients prescribed those medications. The overdoses for TCA were potentially lethal in 47% of the cases. However, all patients who overdosed on psychiatric medications recovered well and were discharged without any sequelae.    DISCUSSION This study suggests that psychiatric medications, particularly benzodiazepines, new antidepressants and antipsychotics, are relatively safe when they are used for self-poisoning. If patients with mental illnesses are under treated, there is a clear and documented higher risk for suicide.   \\n CONCLUSION It is better to prescribe psychiatric medications, particularly the new ones, rather than withhold them due to an exaggerated fear of a lethal overdose.

This technique consists of a complete mobilization of the left subclavian artery extended to the origin of its first branches. The aorta need not be extensively mobilized and the intercostal arteries are individually controlled with snares. After all the proper clamping, the left subclavian artery is detached from the aorta at its origin and is opened longitudinally on its posterior aspect. The anterior wall of the aorta is then incised, beginning with the opening at the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending distally to the descending aorta 12 to 15 mm past the coarctation. The coarctation membrane is excised and the ductus is ligated and divided. The opened left subclavian artery, now forming a flap, is pulled down and sutured to the edges of the aorta, widening the coarctation site and also preserving the blood flow to the left arm. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 months to 25 years (mean 4.24 +/- 4.9 years) and their weights ranged from 2.8 to 52 kg (mean: 14.8 +/- 10.0 kg). There were no hospital deaths and the mean follow-up was 9.6 months (+/- 4.9 months). Recatheterization of four patients from 4 to 12 months postoperatively showed adequate correction and strongly suggested normal growth of the aorta at the site of coarctation, as well as preservation of the blood flow through the left subclavian artery. Doppler measurements showed normal flow to the left arm and no gradients through the isthmic area. Our experience indicates that this technique is not only feasible but is the procedure of choice in most cases of discrete isthmic coarctation and in some cases of long narrowing of the isthmus in patients with a wide range of ages and weights. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides many numerical values, including the ages and weights of the patients in this study, number of hospital deaths and duration of follow-up.

You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list.\\n\\nx = 5, equation weights = [7, 3, 8]","target":"198","rationale":"The given polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 3x + 8\\\\nSubstituting x = 5, we get: 7(5)^2 + 3(5) + 8 = 175 + 15 + 8 = 198"},{"source":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose father died in 1819?, using the article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off.

In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports.\\nThere are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope.\\nBelieve it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight  cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward.

Certain bacterial species, such as the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vesicles, which they use to regulate their buoyancy – allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue. Gas vacuoles, which are freely permeable to gas, are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria. They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy.

The amount of heat generated depends upon how much current flows through a material as well as its electrical resistance: higher currents and lower resistances lead to greater energy transfers and thus faster heating up.

In this paper, we formulate the sequential interactions between user sessions and a recommender agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In practice, the purchase reward is delayed and sparse, and may be buried by clicks, making it an impoverished signal for policy learning. Inspired by the prediction error minimization (PEM) and embodied cognition, we propose a simple architecture to augment reward, namely Imagination Reconstruction Network (IRN). Speciﬁcally, IRN enables the agent to explore its environment and learn predictive representations via three key components. The imagination core generates predicted trajectories, i.e., imagined items that users may purchase. The trajectory manager controls the granularity of imagined trajectories using the planning strategies, which balances the long-term rewards and short-term rewards. To optimize the action policy, the imagination-augmented executor minimizes the intrinsic imagination error of simulated trajectories by self-supervised reconstruction, while maximizing the extrinsic reward using model-free algorithms. Empirically, IRN promotes quicker adaptation to user interest, and shows improved robustness to the cold-start scenario and ultimately higher purchase performance compared to several baselines. Somewhat surprisingly, IRN using only the purchase reward achieves excellent next-click prediction performance, demonstrating that the agent can \\"guess what you like\\" via internal planning.","target":"We propose the IRN architecture to augment sparse and delayed purchase reward for session-based recommendation","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose the IRN architecture to augment sparse and delayed purchase reward for session-based recommendation."},{"source":"\\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\").

Passage 1:Burt was born in Perth to Gladys (née MacMurtrie) and Frederick Julius Augustus Burt. His grandfather was Septimus Burt, who was also a member of parliament and served as Attorney-General of Western Australia. Burt attended Guildford Grammar School, and after leaving school went to the North-West, working variously as a crayfisherman, stationhand, pearler, and tin miner. He opened a machinery and hardware store in Cue in 1935, and in 1939 was elected to the Cue Road Board, of which he eventually became chairman. Burt entered parliament at the 1959 state election, narrowly winning the seat of Murchison from Everard O'Brien of the Labor Party. He transferred to the new seat of Murchison-Eyre at the 1968 election, and retired from parliament at the 1971 election. After leaving politics, Burt held directorships with various mining companies. He died in Perth in November 1993, aged 84, and had married Mary Groom in 1937, with whom he had three sons.\\n Passage 2:In April 1603, Martin Pring used the Haven as his departure point for his exploratory voyage to Virginia. The land comprising the site of Milford, the Manor of Hubberston and Pill, was acquired by the Barlow family following the dissolution of the monasteries in the mid-16th century. It acquired an additional strategic importance in the 17th century as a Royalist military base. Charles I ordered a fort to be built at Pill by Royalist forces and completed in 1643 to prevent Parliamentarian forces from landing at Pembroke Castle and to protect Royalist forces landing from Ireland. On 23 February 1644, a Parliamentarian force led by Rowland Laugharne crossed the Haven and landed at Pill. The fort was gunned from both land and water, and a garrison was placed in Steynton church to prevent a Royalist attack from the garrison at Haverfordwest. The fort was eventually surrendered, and quickly taken, along with St Thomas a Becket chapel. Just five years later in 1649 Milford Haven was again the site of Parliamentarian interest when it was chosen as the disembarkation site for Oliver Cromwell's Invasion of Ireland. Cromwell arrived in the Haven on 4 August, meeting George Monck, before Cromwell and over a hundred crafts left for Dublin on 15 August.\\n Passage 3:Bucks County, an area sympathetic to the Doan Outlaws with a large loyalist population, grew out of William Penn's \\"holy experiment\\", and was guided more by Quaker \\"inner light\\" than by the traditional \\"rights of Englishmen\\". As a result of Penn's effort to create a \\"nation of nations,\\" almost half of colonial Pennsylvania was non-English. In nearby Philadelphia, the elite Proper Philadelphians were rich, charming, tolerant, but had relinquished the role of governing the city. Philadelphia, by common agreement, was the largest, most cosmopolitan but also the most poorly governed city in the Colonies. Bucks County, when compared to Massachusetts in support for a war with England, was still \\"The Peaceable Kingdom\\". No doubt Pennsylvanians were outraged by the actions of the Crown, but they were more likely to express their discontent through resolutions than violent protests. Many Pennsylvanians remained skeptical about cutting ties with England right up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. To illustrate this, the fighting in \\"Penn's Woods\\" started seven years after the Boston Massacre. As for the non-English Pennsylvanian, King George III, even at his worst, was better than what they had known in their homeland. Fat Pennsylvania's legendary prosperity helped ease discord. Bucks County could boast rich farmland, a canal to the sheltered port of Philadelphia, large supplies of fresh water, timber, iron, fire clay, game, and their famous fieldstone for building. The common New Englander by contrast had to choose between hard-scrabble farming or dangerous fishing off rock-ribbed coasts.","target":"1","rationale":"Passage 1 is the only passage that has information about Richard Burt.

There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Do the clouds in Smallville have more or less electrons than the clouds in Klangton?","target":"more","rationale":"The background mentions that wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer.

Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.\\nThe crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.\\nIn 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.

For example, If a baby is not getting full feeling off of just formula, I would make rice cereal and feed the baby that. Some babies are just to big to be satisfied on just milk. Rice is a good filler and does No harm. (like I would not use wheat cereal)\\nI also would give a baby warm tea when they had a stomach ache. Tea of course has caffeine in it. That would not be considered kosher. I also feed My grand daughters sweet tea. They love it. it is better than many sugary corn syrup infested drinks other chose for their children. I use 3/4 cup of sugar for every 2 gallons, so it is NOT much sugar.\\nQuestion: How did the Grandmother feel when the baby vomited?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. unhappy\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC. relieved\\n\\nD. upset","target":"C","rationale":"The grandmother was babysitting for her granddaughter and mistakenly gave the baby vodka instead of water.

This suggests that the grandmother felt concerned about giving a toxic substance to an infant but relieved once they vomited and appeared healthy again.\\nSo, C is correct.\\"\\""},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover , making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania.\\n\\n- A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".\\n\\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- The Meda River is a river in the Kimberley of Western Australia . The river is formed when the Lennard River splits into two channels just north of Mount Marmion , the other channel being the May River . Continuing to flow westward the river eventually discharges into Stokes Bay , King Sound which is north - east of Derby . The river was named in 1881 by a pioneer of the area , George Julius Brockman during an expedition in the Kimberley area . The river is named after HMS Meda , an Admiralty surveying vessel that charted the coastline in the area including the river mouth in 1880 . The traditional owners of the areas around the river are the Ongkarango peoples . The Meda has three tributaries ; The Lennard River , May River and Hawkstone Creek .\\n\\n- The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.\\n\\n- The Great Australian Bight is a large oceanic bight, or open bay, off the central and western portions of the southern coastline of mainland Australia.\\n\\n- The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.\\n\\n- Western Australia (abbreviated as WA) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west, the Great Australian Bight and Southern Ocean to the south, the Northern Territory to the north-east and South Australia to the south-east. Western Australia is Australia's largest state with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres (976,790 sq mi), and the second-largest country subdivision in the world  however, a significant part of it is sparsely populated. The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants, around 11% of the national total. 92% of the population lives in the south-west corner of the state.\\n\\n- An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'mouth of the watercourse' with the subject 'meda river'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- arafura sea\\n - arctic ocean\\n - great australian bight\\n - indian ocean\\n - sea\\n - southern ocean\\n - timor sea","target":"indian ocean","rationale":"Meda River flows into the Indian Ocean.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT DISTINCT ?x0 WHERE {\\n?x0 ns:film.film.directed_by ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.edited_by ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.written_by ?x1 .\\n?x1 a ns:film.film_art_director .\\n?x1 ns:film.producer.film|ns:film.production_company.films M2 .\\n?x1 ns:people.person.nationality ns:m.0d0vqn\\n} Question: What was edited by , directed by , and written by a Swedish art director that produced M2","target":"1","rationale":"The given SQL statement is correct.

The next line gives you \\"?x0 ns:film.film_directed_by ?x1.\\" This says that there exists an x1 such that it is directed by x0 and both are movies, according to the mapping of namespaces to prefixes at the top of each query (ns:film = film). Therefore, any movie must have been directed by some director or else they wouldn't have been able to make it! Note that if we were interested in directors instead, then we could have written \\"?x1 ns:film_director/directed-films ?x2\\" since multiple people can direct a movie together (listed as one film).

The next line says there was an author for whatever movies were edited by whatever editors also did editing work on those same films; again only 1 person can be assigned 1 writing credit even if many people worked on writing one single script together so writing credits are assigned according to WGA guidelines where every writer gets a weighted portion depending on how much they contributed relative to other writers who worked on their script; therefore here our query should be written as \\"?x5 ns:writer/writing-credits ?6\\".

A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working class. Mass migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second-half of the 19th century.

The idea is to collect information about your everyday activities and analyze  them to help improve and form a healthier lifestyle.\\nRecently, tools such as smartphones, apps, along with newly published wearable things, are making self-tracking easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone Up, Google Glass or a smart watch to record personal data  including sleeping hours, stress levels, heart rate and mood.\\nSo why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to know what foods make him sleepy and watch his diet. [:Z#xx#k.Com]\\nTracking daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes food, training and sleep in order to achieve an athletic goal. Similarly, doctors have also helped patients to record parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight health problems. However, it wasn't until 2007 that magazine writers Gary Wolf and Kim Kelly created the term   \\"Quantified Self\\" or  \\"self-tracking\\".\\nAlthough self-tracking has many advantages, Dennis Nash, president of Data Speaks Health Solutions, says self-tracking has its disadvantages.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast.

Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent.\\n\\nAfter the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.  In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.  In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\"  During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\\n\\nWhere sis he live when he was governor?","target":"stay at his home in Maple Grove.","rationale":"The context is clearly talking about the events and actions of Jesse Ventura, which makes it obvious that he was the governor.

But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick feeling in the stomach may say he feels a little green. A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. Sometimes a person may be _ because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a fast new car.

Bank of America, a pioneer in making banking services accessible to the middle class, was founded in San Francisco and in the 1960s, built the landmark modern skyscraper at 555 California Street for its corporate headquarters.

With over 30 international financial institutions, six Fortune 500 companies, and a large support infrastructure of professional services—including law, public relations, architecture and design—San Francisco is designated as an Alpha(-) World City.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate.

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction). Thus, the equal activity of native IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of IGF-I (compared to IGF-II) suggest that the type II receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in L6 myoblasts.","target":"Affinity Labels","rationale":"The abstract provides information about the binding of IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs to type I and type II receptors.

It was based on the animated TV series by Peter Chung, who had a minor role in this film version of his work. In the early stages of production, actress Michelle Rodriguez was considered for the part of Æon. She had previously worked with Kusama in Girlfight. Kusama had originally suggested filming in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, because the 20th-century modern architecture of that city fit with her vision of Bregna. The producers rejected the idea because Brasília lacked the infrastructure and technical expertise to support a major film production. After several cities were scouted, Berlin and Potsdam in Germany were chosen for filming. Berlin had several locations that fit into the organic yet structured world of Æon Flux. The crew gained permission to film in several locations that had never allowed such access before, including the Treptow Crematorium, the Adlershof Trudelturm and Windkanal wind tunnel facility, and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (\\"House of the World's Cultures\\"). Additional locations included the Bauhaus Archive and a dissection theatre built in 1790 to train veterinarians, part of the Berlin animal shelter. It was used as the Handler space.

I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of \\"more is better\\" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.\\nquestion: Is a delicious chocolate?","target":"not sweet enough for me","rationale":"The answer is in the review itself and should not contain extra words.

The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action.

Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king.

We 'officially' cohabitated about 6mo into our relationship when her lease came up. At that time, we made the choice to buy a new queen bed since my full size was too small and her bed was 15 years old and had some extra lumps. Fast forward 8 years, and we bought our first house... and immediately splurged for a nice king size bed which we have greatly enjoyed this last year. \\n\\nIn those intervening 8 years, we lived with my parents in an attached apartment to their farmhouse. It had a separate entrance, 4 rooms, and the only shared space was the kitchen (though we even had our own fridge). I'm an only child, and my family had some serious events go on when I was in my teens / early 20s before i met my now wife.  The apartment space was something my dad and i had renovated together (and by renovated i mean ripped down to bare studs and completely rebuilt) but it was still at my parents and that was a point of contention with my now in-laws.\\n\\nOne of the reasons we had chosen to move in together back into this space involved then girlfriend deciding to go to grad school. While I have a decent paying job, it wasn't, and isn't, enough to support 2 adults and meet all the financial needs of student loan payments, cars, etc on top of rent. My parents let us stay rent free, just happy to have us close by and helping out in other ways. \\n\\nFast forward, and my wife is out of school, we've saved up and paid for our own wedding, then save up to buy a house. My parents are super supportive of the house buying, but sad to see us go. Dad helps renovate the new house, refinishing floors, painting, doing custom woodwork etc.  We move in a bit peicemeal over a  few months, but are close enough (20min) that ee don't have to rent a moving truck etc.\\n\\nNow, I'm not debating that I'm an asshole for this next part... I totally own that i fucked up here. Due to work and some personal commitments, i drop the ball after we've gotten about half of our stuff out of the old apartment. My parents make comments once and a while, but NBD. Then time goes on and it's suddenly been a year since we lived there and our shit still sits in that space. For some reason, getting my wife to go help pack the rest up is impossible. I've been chipping away at the small stuff, but the bed is still there. One of the major reasons is that whilenour new master bedroom is huge, it stole that space from the second (guest) bedroom. We've measured, and while technically the queen bed would fit, it would touch 3 walls and be a bitch to put sheets on.\\n\\nNow we get to the meat of it. About a month ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. He's started chemo and will likely be looking at a pretty significant surgery down the line if the chemo/radiation goes well.  My parents approached me about the apartment and specifically bed, as the space is better insulated (remember, major renovation) and had first floor connection to their kitchen. They ask if we would be willing to move the queen bed downstairs into the old living room so that dad isn't doing stairs etc.  I say I have to talk to my wife, but don't expect it to be an issue because it doesnt fit the space and we havent gotten it in the last year.\\n\\nNope. Big deal. Wife says have to have it as a guest bed. I've tried to get her to go with me to get it out the last two weekends, she has cone up with excuses not to. My parents want an answer.\\n\\nAs a point, as far as i know there are no weord feelings between my parents and wife. They've always been very supportive of her, and she has no issue when they come visit us.\\n\\nAITA for just wanting to give it to them since we lived there rent free for so long and Dad has done so much for us in the new house?\\n\\nWIBTA if i just do it since she won't help get it out even though I could get a friend to go with me to help?","target":"answerable","rationale":"The couple has been married for a few years and purchased their first home together.

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets.

His job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had \\"about a quarter of a load\\" of stones carted away.Monday, 16 August 1819, was a hot summer's day, with a cloudless blue sky.

There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. According to the Washington Times on April 15, however, the Chinese government was attempting to \\"calm the situation\\" through censorship: \\"All comments posted on popular Internet forum Sohu.com relating to a boycott of Carrefour have been deleted.\\" Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Nazism's Swastika to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. The Carrefour boycott was met with anti-boycott demonstrators who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming, only to be blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles.

The defense was unable to stop the running duo of Vick and RB Warrick Dunn, whose combined performance netted 261 yards, and 306 for Atlanta as a team&#8212;a new Falcons team record. Also illustrating their sharp fall in performance from their #1 NFL ranking the previous season, the Bucs' defense also allowed a 1-yard QB TD run by Vick and a 4-yard TD pass to RB Fred McCrary. Bucs QB Chris Simms continued to struggle, throwing another three interceptions, while Carnell Williams was held to just 37 yards on 15 carries.

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the 'cydippids' are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.

Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation.\\n\\nMy best friend of 15 years, and the best man at my wedding, \\"Donny\\" \\\\[32m\\\\] is super fun to hang out with, and is usually up for anything.  We've gone on countless adventures together - sailing, backpacking, camping, ATVing, lan parties (showing our age!), motorcycle trips, canoe camping, etc. \\n\\nThe problem is, he's never really gotten his shit together.  He hasn't held a job for longer than a year, and has lived no less than 20 places in his life.  After his girlfriend of 9 years cheated on him, got pregnant during the fling, guilted him into being the father while debating an abortion, then had a miscarriage... he decided to finally seek professional help, and end that relationship.  He's been diagnosed with depression/ADD/alcoholism/anxiety and is taking prescribed medication to work through those issues.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, for the past few years he's been living with his narcissistic mom. But it's okay because she's a  changed woman, and now dishes out cutting remarks with a smile and a soft voice.  Donny thinks she can be annoying, but not \\"all that bad.\\"\\n\\nI strongly disagreed, and after working though my own issues with narcissists, I wanted to help him get out of that environment and start a life of his own.  He had been making such good progress seeking help and going on medication I thought she was the last thing holding him back.  \\n\\nHe's never actually lived on his own.  He's always lived/been supported by other people, including his mom and me in the past.  After I lived alone in a private seasonal campground for a month to get my own head on straight about some issues I was dealing with, I thought how great of an opportunity it would be for him to live there full time.  He could buy a camper for 5-7k, and pay $1500 in rent each year for the plot.  Cost of living would be extremely low ($125 rent/month - plus food, electricity and propane).  It's filled with friendly blue-collar workers who leave their campers there year round and treat it like a vacation cabin.  They are all having a blast, drinking, socializing, telling tall tails, driving around in golf carts, etc.  It's just a fun place to be, and an upgrade from his only other realistic option - a trailer park.  The mood at a trailer park is different I'd think... most people live there out of necessity not desire, and that probably wouldn't help him with his mental health.\\n\\nHe thought the camper/campground was a great idea so I helped him pick out an old 26 foot camper, inspect it (surprisingly good shape), talk the seller down ($1200 to $800) and borrow a friends truck to tow it home.  He paid for it of course.  I told him he could live in it at my house as long as he paid his own electricity and didn't barge in to our house without first calling/texting.  The plan was for him to live in it, fix it up, then sell it and upgrade to a better 5-7k camper and ultimately move into a seasonal campground.  (They have restrictions on age/condition of the campers they let in.)  We set an August 1st 2019 move out deadline (about a year).\\n\\nDuring this time my wife and I were planning our honeymoon - sailing around the Virgin Islands.  Then Hurricane Irma hit, destroying everything on the islands.  We decided on Costa Rica for our honeymoon instead.  The charter company in the Virgin Islands could only give credit rather than a refund, so we planned to go the following year.  (Quick note, we are not rich and these two trips were very expensive for us.  We had only budgeted for one.)  I suggested that we turn it into a trip with friends since plane tickets were only $400 round trip.  Since we had already paid for the boat, it wouldn't cost any more to bring a few people along.  So we invited Donny and my wife's friend \\"Sarah\\".  Both single, but they didn't hit it off.  They only had to buy plane tickets, and pay their own expenses like food, taxis and souvenirs - we would cover the \\\\~4k boat rental.\\n\\nThey were invited in April, and we planned to fly there in December - 8 months later.  I kept everyone updated by email with itineraries and estimated personal costs as I planned out the trip.\\n\\nAt some point during all of this, Donny has moved into his camper at my house, begins reverting to old ways, stops showing up for his full time job, and gets fired.  He picks up a part time job where he has the option to work 40 hours a week, but can work as much or as little as he wants.  He of course picks the latter.  I'm beginning to suspect that he won't have enough money for the trip so I ask him about it.  He assures me he will have enough and all is good.  He already bought the plane tickets.\\n\\nSo we fly out of cold ass Wisconsin and into the tropics.  Everyone is in high spirits, I mean, how can you not be?  We get to our rental sailboat, a 2017 Jeanneau 349, and it's a fucking dream boat.  We set sail and go from island to island, sleeping in the boat.  It's amazing.  Dolphins, white sandy beaches, perfect weather, beach-side restaurants, 85 degree water, snorkeling, you name it.  Then it happens.  **The ambush.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDonny - waiting until my wife and Sarah are off the boat - \\"I'm out of money, I didn't realize how expensive everything was going to be... is there any chance you can spot me until we get back?  I'll pay you back, I promise\\".\\n\\nNow I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I say no, he can't get home.  If I say yes, I may not be able to pay my own bills when we return, and might never get paid back.  Nothing good can come from this conversation.  \\n\\nI gave in however, and asked him how much he needed.  After some hemming and hawing, he said $100 should cover everything.  Ok.  Borrowed him $100 - in cash.\\n\\nNot two days later he's out of money again.  I'm pissed.  I tell him tough luck and the three of us go enjoy the day while he sleeps on the boat.  Paradise gets me back into a good mood though, and I start to feel bad.  *Yeah... I know.*  If he can't pay the ferry ride back, or the taxis, he's stranded in the Virgin Islands.  *This alone would make for a good AITA post if I just left him there*... but I begrudgingly decide borrow him money for the rest of the trip.  On the bright side, Sarah is having no problem paying her own way throughout the trip.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter we get back home I don't really talk to him much.  The trip, amazing as it was, has an underlying shitty feel to it all.  I feel taken advantage of and it bothers me that he, my best friend of so many years, was so selfish and entitled during the trip of a lifetime.  Captain obvious senses something is wrong and texts me that he will pay me back this weekend.  Weeks go by and nothing.  I confront him.  Turns out, he wasn't even keeping track of what he owed me!  Thank fuck I was - $373 just for the trip!!\\n\\nI pull up his electric bills for the camper.  I charge him $0.13/kWh, send him monthly emails \\"bills\\" with pictures of the Kill-A-Watt meter, and allow 30 days to pay.  He's 90+ days late and hasn't paid anything. $115 behind.  Reminders answered with silence.  **It's the final straw, I'm fed up and go into asshole mode.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI forward the electric bill emails, and tell him he has 5 business days (Tuesday) to pay all late bills in full, or I'll disconnect his electric service.  I also add a $20 late fee to all future bills that become late.  Weather forecast is for 20F at night.  No electricity = no heat and frozen/broken water lines.  I hear nothing back.\\n\\nI have a face to face with him and express my general frustration about the trip, owed money and overdue electric bills.  He does his best to act sorry and promises to make things right.  I don't mention that I'm going to disconnect the power, but it was in the emails sent days earlier.\\n\\nA few days later I invite him over for dinner, mostly to get the pictures he took on his phone during the trip.  He said he'd upload them, but was clearly dragging his feet with misc half-truths.  I **never** bring up that I'm killing the electric on Tuesday unless he pays just the late electric bills.  Unprompted, he says something like \\"I'll pay you for the electric bills on Tuesday or Wednesday.\\" \\n\\nHe knows he won't get paid until Wednesday.  I know he won't get paid until Wednesday, but he doesn't know that.  I still plan to pull the power Tuesday if he hasn't paid, but instead of saying that, I just say \\"Ok.\\"\\n\\nIronically, the Kill-A-Watt meter fails a few hours later, killing his power.  15A heater + fridge + computer overloaded it.  He offers to pay for a new one (about $15) and I plug him back in unmetered.\\n\\nTuesday rolls along, and at 5pm I text him telling him I'm disconnecting the power in an hour unless all overdue electric bills are paid in full.  The following conversation ensues over text:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Donny:** \\"You couldn't have told me this yesterday?  I told you I'm gonna pay it tomorrow\\" \\\\[Wednesday\\\\].\\n\\n**Me:** \\"It was in both emails.\\"\\n\\n**Donny:** \\"That's great.

This locomotive and the SD45T-2 are popularly called tunnel motors, but EMD's term is SD40-2s with \\"cooling system modifications\\" because they were designed for better engine cooling in tunnels. The difference between this locomotive and its non-tunnel motor cousin, the SD40-2, are the radiator intakes and radiator fan grills located at the rear of the locomotive.

This locomotive differs from the otherwise identical EMD GP15 - 1 due to Missouri Pacific specifying new AR10 AC alternators instead of rebuilt D32 DC generators . The only external difference between the GP15AC and the GP15 - 1 is a straight side sill ( shared with the EMD GP15T ) not related to the transmission difference . 30 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads , with four units built for Venezuela 's IFE .\\n\\n- The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors.

Passage:Pieter van Laer (1599 – c. 1642) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of genre scenes, active for over a decade in Rome, where his nickname was Il Bamboccio. Artists working in his style, who often painted just such scenes of everyday life as Pliny lists, became known as the Bamboccianti, painters in Bamboccio's manner. Peiraikos is often mentioned in the controversies over the Bamboccianti, for example by Salvator Rosa in his Satires, and later by the Dutch biographer of artists, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten in his Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst (Introduction to the Academy of Painting), Rotterdam 1678. As genre painting became an important element of Dutch Golden Age painting, Peiraikos was used to provide classical precedent for such work, in the relatively few discussions of the appropriateness of such art by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck (1604) and Arnold Houbraken in his The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters (1718–1719). Having originally been often rather cheap, by the late 17th century the best Dutch genre scenes became sought after by collectors across Europe at very high prices, a development following Pliny's account of Peiraikos that was bemoaned by Lessing in his Laocoon (1763), mentioning Dutch painting specifically.","target":"b","rationale":"The question asks where the group of artists painting in Bamboccio's  manner operate, but the passage only includes a list of cities that have one or more artists working in his style, not necessarily operating there."},{"source":"Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants.

Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area.

He comes around around 5:00 and the movie starts at 8:00 so he lays on the couch and we’re just watching the TV. \\n     It’s at this point where he falls asleep. I had just gotten home from a 7-4 shift at the hospital and all he had done all day up to this point is sleep. It’s around 6:00 when I try to wake him up, and he refuses to move. He says he’s not going anymore. I continue to try for the next 20 minutes to get him to move and he refuses to move or talk to me. \\n     I still live with my mom and my brothers, so I asked my brother if he wanted to go, so I just left my boyfriend there sleeping and went to the movies with my little brother who loves the Marvel movies anyways. \\n    My mom ended up coming home and kicking him out, but now he’s pissed. I’m just wondering... am I the asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post planned a movie date with her boyfriend, but he was unresponsive and failed to show up. The author then decided to take her younger brother on the date instead of simply canceling it. There is no reason for the author to be upset at her boyfriend for missing their date, as she ended up going on it anyway with someone else. Therefore, the answer is 'yes' and AUTHOR is wrong here.\\n</code>"},{"source":"You are given a sentence and your task is to generate another sentence that supports the given input.\\n\\nFor example, the volume of a gas decreases as the pressure of the gas increases, for a constant temperature.","target":"Decreasing the volume of a gas and keeping everything else the same will cause its pressure to increase","rationale":"The input sentence describes the scientific fact that \\"the volume of a gas decreases as the pressure of the gas increases, for a constant temperature\\".

That described my life pretty well as a single mom. I was raising two teenagers on a teacher's aide's salary. It wasn't nearly enough to cover the bills, so I moonlighted as a waitress. Every time I thought that I had found a solution to my money worries, something would fall through and I would end up feeling worse off than before.\\nThe next evening at the restaurant I tried on my apron, wishing I could be home with my kids. I walked up to my first table. Around it was a cheerful older couple. The woman gave me a smile that warmed me. I couldn't help but notice her unusual glass ring. \\"What a beautiful ring,\\" I said. We chatted for a minute then I took their order and left. When I came back with their drinks, the woman held out her ring. \\"I would like to give this to you,\\" she said.\\n\\"Oh, no, I couldn't,\\" I said, embarrassed.\\nShe gently placed the ring in my hand and closed my fingers around it. \\"It's yours,\\" she said. \\"Please accept it and your things are going to be okay.\\" Right there at their table in the middle of the restaurant I broke down in tears. \\"Thank you for giving me hope,\\" I said.\\nLong after that night, that sense of peace stayed with me. I knew the right job would come in time. Nine months later it did. I got a better position at another school and I started waitressing at a restaurant where I was allowed to spend more time with my kids.\\nNow in these tough times, I have money worries again, but they don't get me down. I know things will turn out okay. And when I wear that unusual glass ring, I'm reminded I'm not alone.\\nFrom the saying \\"Two steps forward and three steps back\\", it means the writer  _  .\\nA) liked stepping forward and backward\\nB) had difficulty raising her family\\nC) couldn't walk regular like other people\\nD) wanted to look for a better job","target":"B","rationale":"The saying “Two steps forward and three steps back” means that every time you make progress towards a goal, something bad happens and you go further away from your goal. The author describes this in the first few sentences of her story where she says that no matter how hard she tried to solve her money problems, things kept going wrong for her. This shows us that the writer is having difficulty raising her family because of financial difficulties. So the answer is B: had difficulty raising her family"},{"source":"Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo from Paris formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and had continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.\\n\\nBangalter and Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English as a second language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: \\"It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.\\" They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that \\"put everything together\\" in terms of genre\\".  The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contain a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter stated: \\"In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty--it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too.\\" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, \\"before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people.\\" The Daft Punk track \\"Teachers\\", from Homework, refers to several influences, such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo stated: \\"Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions--the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul--is part of how we sound today.\\" A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in \\"Teachers\\", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework, and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by Daniel Vangarde, father of Bangalter.  Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk on tracks for Discovery. For the album, Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single \\"Windowlicker\\", which was \\"neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track\\", according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of an artist from a previous era. As stated by Homem-Christo, \\"On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,\\" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, Homem-Christo clarified that \\"we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.\\" Daft Punk would collaborate with Edwards again on the song \\"Fragments of Time\\", featured on the 2013 album Random Access Memories.  During a 2009 interview, Bangalter named Andy Warhol as one of Daft Punk's early artistic influences. For the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, the duo drew inspiration from Wendy Carlos, the composer of the original Tron film, as well as Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Carpenter, Vangelis, Philip Glass and Maurice Jarre. Daft Punk later sought a \\"west coast vibe\\" during the production of Random Access Memories, referencing such bands as Fleetwood Mac, The Doobie Brothers and the Eagles. They also highlighted the influence of Jean Michel Jarre in an interview following the album's release. In January 2017, London-based music publication FACTmag featured a 1000 track playlist of Daft Punk's influences to mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Homework.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"Have they received any awards?","rationale":"The article talks about the sources that influenced their musical style.

The band announced in April 2012 that Bill Stevenson, who had previously worked with NOFX and Rise Against, would be the producer for their sixth album.  On June 22, 2012, the band announced that their sixth album would be titled Awakened and the first single \\"Cauterize\\" was released on June 25, 2012. On September 12, 2012, As I Lay Dying released their second single \\"A Greater Foundation\\" with a corresponding music video. The album was released on September 25, 2012 and \\"Cauterize\\" was available on the band's website as a free download for a 24-hour period. As I Lay Dying won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire in 2012, beating other well-known bands, including Anthrax and Lamb of God. Subsequently, prior to his criminal charges, Lambesis started a new band entitled Pyrithion with guitarist Ryan Glisan, formerly of Allegaeon. They released one EP as a band.  On May 7, 2013, Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside, California, US after allegedly hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report was made by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: \\"The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can.\\" They also stated that their thoughts were \\"with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.\\" Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that \\"we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted\\". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded \\"not guilty\\" and his lawyer stated: \\"His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use.\\" On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from \\"not guilty\\" to \\"guilty\\" and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.  Rather than continue on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with former members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, decided to focus on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying. During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.

Six weeks is a very long time to have it. I was under the impression you had it for about a month then felt awful for another couple of weeks. Initial symptoms commonly include: 1  Loss of appetite. 2  Chills. 3  Mental and physical fatigue/weakness. 4  Aching muscles. 5  These symptoms are usually followed 2-3 days later by: 6  Fever. 7  Headache. 8  Sore, reddened throat with enlarged tonsils. 9  Swollen glands in the neck, armpits and/or groin. Some people become infected with EBV but do not develop symptoms. This is called a subclinical infection. How long do the symptoms last? The glandular fever symptoms usually resolve by themselves within two to three weeks of the initial infection. Initial three to five days will be the worst followed by improvement in a gradual course. The fever usually lasts for 10 to 14 days and declines in severity after the initial three to five days. Fatigue however may persist for up to three to six months. Normal activity may be resumed within one to two months of the infection. In young children the onset of the glandular fever is usually short term. Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing (it is often referred to as the kissing disease) exposure to coughs and sneezes. sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed forks and spoons. https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/glandular-fever The information on this site should not be used as an alternative to professional care. If you have a particular problem, see a doctor or other health professional. The most common symptoms of glandular fever are: 1  a high temperature (fever) 2  a sore throat – usually more painful than any previous throat infection you may have had. 3  swollen glands (nodes) in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits. 4  fatigue (extreme tiredness) Infectious mononucleosis, commonly known as glandular fever, is a viral infection, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The disease is, among other things, characterised by a sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and extreme fatigue. Future prospects Glandular fever usually takes two to four weeks and resolves itself without complications. In about 3 per cent of all cases, it goes on longer. After having the disease, a person will have lifelong immunity to it, so will not catch it again. Take heart though because the majority of adults in this country have had it and have no long term ill-effects. well, let's put it this way: you can't get much fitter than Roger Federer, who is also only 26 years old. he had glandular fever earlier this year and only just now got back to full fitness. 29-11-2009 06:53.

After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal.

Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. Dave Kushner, who had previously played with McKagan in Loaded, then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by VH1. Eventually, former Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland joined the band.  In 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, \\"Set Me Free\\". In June 2004, they released their debut album, Contraband, which debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, Libertad, and embarked on a second tour. During a show in March 2008, Weiland announced to the audience that it would be the band's final tour; he was fired from the band in April 2008, Slash insisted \\"chemical issues\\" led to the split. The following month Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. Despite Weiland's departure, Velvet Revolver did not officially disband.  In early 2010, Velvet Revolver began writing new songs and auditioning new singers. By January 2011, the band had recorded nine demos, and was reportedly due to make a decision on their singer.

British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular.

The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth $7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at $14 million after the first year and $21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid $5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season. \\nBased on the previous passage, Who made his debut during the 2006-2007 season? \\nIs \\"Chelsea right back Jeffren Suarez\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The context of the question has to do with who made their debut during a certain season, 2006-2007.

Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Passage:In 2001 Crouch had his best year, breaking school or NCAA records almost weekly and appearing to be a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy. In the first game of the 2001 season, a 21-7 defeat of TCU, Crouch surpassed Tommie Frazier as Nebraska's all-time total offense leader. He became the Big 12 all-time career rushing quarterback in the emotionally charged game against Rice. The next week, against Missouri, Crouch was backed up near the goal line when he scrambled to escape from defenders and pulled off a 95-yard touchdown run, the longest in school history. Against Iowa State the following week, Crouch broke the record for career touchdowns by a quarterback. Crouch became only the fourth player in Division 1 history to both pass and rush for 3,000 yards in a career with his performance against Texas Tech. Next, in a hard-fought game against defending national champion Oklahoma, Crouch again showed off his speed and playmaking abilities, this time serving as quarterback and receiver in a single play, the famous \\"Black 41 Flash Reverse Pass\\" in which Crouch made a 63-yard touchdown reception. By mid-November Crouch had set a school record for most career wins as a starter and became only the ninth quarterback in D-1A history to have won 35 games as a starter. The Cornhuskers were 11-0 going into the annual contest with Colorado the day after Thanksgiving. Crouch had a career day, setting the school record for offense yards in a single game with 360 yards. The Nebraska defense was dominated by the Buffaloes, however, and gave up a then-record 62 points to Colorado. The 62-36 loss appeared to have ended Nebraska's hopes of playing for the national championship and to have hurt Crouch's chances of winning the Heisman. Two weeks later, Crouch was announced as the recipient of the award, edging out Florida's Rex Grossman and Miami's Ken Dorsey in the closest Heisman ballot since 1985. His outstanding season also was recognized when he won the Davey O'Brien Award for being the best collegiate quarterback in the nation during the 2001 season. In the meantime several highly ranked teams were upset and in the final BCS rankings, Nebraska beat out one-loss Oregon and two-loss Colorado to earn the No. 2 spot in the BCS rankings. The final BCS rankings were steeped in controversy since Nebraska had the chance to play in the Rose Bowl for the national championship despite not winning a conference or division championship. In the Rose Bowl on January 3, 2002, Crouch rushed for 114 yards against the Miami Hurricanes but was denied a touchdown for the first time since September, 1999. The No. 1 Hurricanes defeated the Cornhuskers 37-14, leaving Crouch with a 35-7 record as a starting quarterback.","target":"a","rationale":"The question requires information from both \\"Cornhuskers\\" and \\"Colorado\\", which are the teams that Crouch faced and broke records in a span of a week."},{"source":"Daniel John \\"Dan\\" Devine (December 22, 1924 - May 9, 2002) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Arizona State University from 1955 to 1957, the University of Missouri from 1958 to 1970, and the University of Notre Dame from 1975 to 1980, compiling a career college football mark of 173-56-9. Devine was also the head coach of the National Football League's Green Bay Packers from 1971 to 1974, tallying a mark of 25-27-4. His 1977 Notre Dame team won a national championship after beating Texas in the Cotton Bowl.\\n\\nDevine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired. When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history. In his six seasons at Notre Dame, Devine compiled a 53-16-1 mark (.764). His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the Fighting Irish won the 1977 national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana. The regular season was highlighted by the Irish's 21-17 come-from-behind win over Clemson at Death Valley, when Devine repeatedly gave the middle finger salute to the raucous home crowd. The championship season was completed with a convincing 38-10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell. The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls.  Earlier in the season, before the annual game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, which would remain for the rest of his time at the school. He also added names to the players' jerseys on a permanent basis when he took over at Notre Dame. Previously, names had been included on jerseys only during bowl games. (The traditional navy blue & white jerseys without names returned in the 1980s under Lou Holtz.) Devine's teams won three bowl games, including consecutive Cotton Bowl Classics. In the 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic, the Irish trailed 34-12 with 7:27 remaining in the game. They rallied for 23 unanswered points behind ailing senior quarterback Joe Montana for an incredible 35-34 victory over Houston. The game became part of college football folklore, referred to as the Chicken Soup Game.  Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship. After a 5-2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances). Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \\"Dump Devine\\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium. He also had the notoriety of losing to his old program, a shocking 3-0 loss to the Tigers at South Bend in 1978. It wasn't until after Devine had left Notre Dame that fans began to appreciate him.  Like Joe Kuharich before him, Devine was involved in a game while at Notre Dame whose ending resulted in a rule change still in effect today. On September 15, 1979, the Irish faced the Michigan Wolverines in Ann Arbor in their season opener. With six seconds remaining, Michigan lined up for a game-winning field goal attempt. Notre Dame linebacker Bob Crable climbed up onto the back of opposing long snapper Mike Trgovac and was able to block the kick, preserving a 12-10 Irish victory.

In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England rapproached France in 1670, after the War of Devolution. In April 1672, Sweden and France concluded an alliance, with France promising 400,000 riksdalers of subsidies in peace time, to be raised to 600,000 in war time, for Sweden maintaining a 16,000 men strong army in her German dominions. Also, Sweden maintained good relations to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp south of Denmark. By September 1674, Sweden had enlarged her army to 22,000 men after France had increased the subsidies to 900,000 riksdalers, which she threatened to withdraw if Sweden was not using this army, stationed in Swedish Pomerania, for an attack on her adversaries. By December, the Swedish army had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom stationed in Bremen, 2,000 to 3,000 in Wismar, 6,000 to 7,000 in Pomeranian garrisons, and 13,000 free to operate under Lord High Constable and field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel.\\n\\nQuestion: What locations were the men of the Swedish army stationed at after it had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men in December?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Bremen","rationale":"The answer to this problem is \\"Bremen\\".

It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition.\\n\\nSpirit drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, Spirit reached the first of many targets at the base of the Columbia Hills called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \\"Pot of Gold\\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the Mossbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite. This kind of rock can be built in connection with water.  As the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail. The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.  From here, Spirit took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, Spirit had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \\"Clovis\\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226-235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281-295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296-303). From Sols 239 to 262, Spirit powered down for solar conjunction, when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, Spirit made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \\"Cumberland Ridge\\" and into \\"Larry's Lookout\\" and \\"Tennessee Valley\\".

While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.

His dog died a couple years later, but he had already gotten a second dog before she passed, and didn't want another animal. Okay, fine. But then we ended up fostering two *other* dogs in the meantime. Through the years he's always said he hates cats. And he's \\"teased\\" me about there never being a deal that I would adopt another cat. We ended up spending a lot of time with friends who had two cats and two dogs who are not well behaved and he constantly talked about how nice it is to only have one animal and how he doesn't ever want more than one.

Whenever somebody close in the family falls I'll or something bad happens, Im always the last person to find out, and it's always from somebody else. When I was at university, she failed to tell me for months that my nan had been diagnosed with cancer. This was the first time (to my knowledge) she'd done this, and where my issue with it all started. She said it was so that I wouldn't get stressed during my exams, which I can understand, but I explained to her that it was my nan and I had a right to know, and for future reference could she please tell me as I didn't want her to bare the burden alone. We're all family. She agreed. Fast forward a year and my nans cancer has taken a turn for the worst I get that this is her mother and she had her own coping system, but the only reason I found out was because my step brother told me. I chose to not say anything about her breaking her promise and consoled her as much as I could.\\n\\nThere have been other little things here and there after this, like my stepdad having a stroke and my brother's telling me, but I'm going to fast forward past this to last year. I was walking in the street of my old hometown and bumped into an old friend of the family and got chatting. After all the formalities, I was asked how my mom was doing now and if she was feeling better. Absolutely dumbfounded I asked what he meant, it turned out  that she'd had troubles with her womb and needed to have a hysterectomy, but they couldn't operate on her because she'd also had some issues with circulation in her legs and had a bad blood clot and some other issues (my memory of the whole ordeal is hazy and everytime I asked mom about this she'd always tell me it was nothing and not to worry). So after I confronted mom about not telling me this, I got the usual didn't want to worry me, and it wasn't that big a deal etc etc. I did lose my shit a little bit with this one, because as her only child I should be made aware of these things and how would she like it if I withheld information like that from her. \\n\\nShe then apologised and again told me that she would let me know for future reference. In her defence, she did keep me up to date with what was going on with her for a while, and gave me dates when she had her hysterectomy surgery so I was there for her and gave all the support I could. However, after the surgery she failed to tell me the one thing I worried would happen, that during the surgery her bladder got perverated and caused her to be incontinent. She tried to keep this from me for weeks until my stepdad told me. I again tried to have a stern but fair conversation with her. She's not been able to work nearly a year now while she's been on the waiting list to have repairation surgery, but did keep me up to date with appointments again.\\n\\nFast forward to today and I've just received a call from my step brother telling me that she's had her surgery today but hasn't came out yet.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\\n\\nTo optimize a neural network one often thinks of optimizing its parameters, but it is ultimately a matter of optimizing the function that maps inputs to outputs. Since a change in the parameters might serve as a poor proxy for the change in the function, it is of some concern that primacy is given to parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here, we show that it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between functions in a $L^2$ Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in this space, and compare how parameter $\\\\ell^2$ distances compare to function $L^2$ distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular, the $L^2/\\\\ell^2$ ratio decreases throughout optimization, reaching a steady value around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the $L^2$ distance could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask learning, one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly, we propose a new learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned. These applications demonstrate how one can measure and regularize function distances directly, without relying on parameters or local approximations like loss curvature.","target":"We find movement in function space is not proportional to movement in parameter space during optimization.

More bacterial isolates per tonsil were recovered in adults (10.2 per tonsil) than in children (8.4 per tonsil). The difference between these groups was due to a higher recovery rate in adults of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (1.6 isolates per adult, 0.8 per child) and Bacteroides fragilis group (0.4 per adult, 0.2 per child). Conversely, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated in seven (28%) children as compared to their isolation in one (4%) adult. More isolates of beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPO) per tonsil were recovered in adults. Forty-three BLPO were detected in 21 (91%) of the 23 tonsils removed from adults (1.9 isolates per patient) as compared to 31 isolates in 16 (64%) of the 25 tonsils removed from children (1.2 isolates per patient) (P = 0.04). These findings suggest that the etiology of recurrent tonsillitis in adults may differ from that in children.

The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown. They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion. In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya.
