The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.\\n\\n- Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.\\n\\n- Cynethryth (\\"Cyneðryð\\"; died after AD 798) was a Queen of Mercia and wife of King Offa of Mercia and mother of King Ecgfrith of Mercia. Cynethryth is the only Anglo-Saxon Queen consort in whose name coinage was definitely issued.\\nBiography.\\nOrigins.\\nNothing certain is known of Cynethryth's origins. Her name recalls the wife and daughters of King PendaCynewise, Cyneburh, and Cyneswithwhich may indicate that she was a descendant of Penda. \\n\\n- The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.\\n\\n- Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.\\n\\n- The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Ecgfrith was king of Mercia from 29 July to December 796 . He was the son of Offa , the greatest king of Mercia , and Cynethryth . In 787 , Ecgfrith had been consecrated king , the first known consecration of an English king , probably arranged by Offa in imitation of the consecration of Charlemagne 's sons by the pope in 781 . According to the Croyland Chronicle \`\` he ( Ecgfrith ) was seized with a malady , and departed this life . '' His reign lasted 141 days . Ecgfrith was succeeded by a distant relative , Cœnwulf , presumably because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate dynastic rivals . According to a contemporary letter from Alcuin of York , an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne 's court as one of his chief advisors : That most noble young man has not died for his sins , but the vengeance for the blood shed by the father has reached the son . For you know how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom upon his son . Alcuin added : \`\` This was not a strengthening of the kingdom , but its ruin . ''\\n\\n- Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King Æthelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.\\n\\n- In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'father' with the subject 'ecgfrith of mercia'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- charlemagne\\n - discovery\\n - holy roman emperor\\n - include\\n - julius caesar\\n - octavian\\n - offa of mercia\\n - zeno\\n - æthelberht","target":"offa of mercia","rationale":"The answer is offa of mercia."},{"source":"Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users.

We performed a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate current evidence on the use of miRNA assays to diagnose BCa.   \\n METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published before March 31, 2015. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the overall test performance. Subgroup analyses were used to explore the between-study heterogeneity. Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test was used to test publication bias. We applied the software of RevMan 5.2 and Stata 11.0 to the meta-analysis.   \\n RESULTS A total of 23 studies from nine articles were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 719 patients and 494 controls. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.80) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 3.03 (95% CI, 2.50-3.67); negative likelihood ratio was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.27-0.42); and diagnostic odds ratio was 9.07 (95% CI, 6.35-12.95). The pooled AUC was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.85). Subgroup analyses indicated that the multiple miRNAs assays and urine supernatant assays showed high accuracies in diagnosing BCa.   \\n CONCLUSION The miRNA assays may serve as potential noninvasive diagnostic tool for the detection of BCa. However, the clinical application of miRNA assays for BCa diagnosis still needs further validation by large prospective studies..

This time, the matchup proved lopsided. After receiving the opening kickoff, short passes to Steven Jackson and Austin Pettis moved the ball to the Rams 44. Next, back-to-back Jackson rushes moved the ball to midfield. On the next play Sam Bradford threw a 50-yard touchdown strike to Chris Givens for a 7-0 lead. The Rams wouldn't score again. The Patriots countered on their next drive, marching 77 yards in 8 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass to Lloyd. Brady extended his streak of consecutive games with a touchdown pass to 40 behind Johnny Unitas and Drew Brees. After a Rams punt, the Patriots marched 84 yards in 9 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Vereen on 4th-and-goal. After another punt the Patriots began to put the game away. Taking over at their own 22, aided by a 32-yard screen to Gronkowski on 3rd-and-4, the Patriot raced 78 yards in 9 plays with Brady throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 21-7. Gronkowski celebrated the touchdown by acting like a castle guard before spiking the ball. The Rams drove to the Patriots 35 on their next drive, but attempted a fake field goal that resulted in a 9-yard loss. The Patriots wasted no time, racing 56 yards in 9 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Ridley with just&#160;:10 seconds left in the half. Bradford took a knee and the game went to halftime with the Patriots winning 28-7. The Patriots continued to speed up against a tired Rams defense in the second half. Taking the opening drive, the Patriots raced 80 yards in just 6 plays with Brady throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to Lloyd, blowing the game open 35-7.  The Rams offense continued to show no signs of life, going three-and-out again and he Patriots took advantage, driving 58 yards to the Rams 35 and Gostkowski increased the lead to 38-7 on his 53-yard field goal. After both teams punted on their next drive, the Rams drove to the Patriots 41, but turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots moved quickly again, driving 55 yards and scoring on Brady's 14-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. With the game out of reach, the Rams drove to the Patriots 25 on their next drive, but Dennard intercepted Bradford at the 4 and returned it 8 yards to the 12. The Patriots punted on their next drive, and the Rams responded by driving to the Patriots 15, but Tavon Wilson intercepted Kellen Clemens at the 1-yard line and returned it 45 yards to the Patriots 46. Ryan Mallett took three knees and the game was over. Brady threw for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns, 2 each to Lloyd and Gronkowski. The Patriots improved to 2-0 in games played in London, having defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers there in 2009.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.\\n\\nParagraph: Two lands applied different economical measures over the last decade.

Therefore in this case it can be deduced that the residents of Greenland would report higher levels of satistfaction than those living in Iceland because they are wealthier as a result of increasing their productivity compared to Iceland who had little money left after expanding its government spending on taxes. \\nIn conclusion, based on these two paragraphs together, we think the answer should be \\"Greenland\\"."},{"source":"\\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\").

Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited Principles of Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of The Weald had taken 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”.\\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...\\nQuestion: The writer believes that\\nOptions:\\n- researching is good\\n- not enough information\\n- Changing environment can inspire thought\\n- thinking outside the box is good","target":"Changing environment can inspire thought","rationale":"In the context we can read that \\"creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions\\".

It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.","target":"sample B","rationale":"Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium, which means it has a percentage of 1% U-235 and 99% U-238.

While Dio claims that both the purpose-built naumachia of Augustus and the amphitheatre itself were flooded for two separate shows, Suetonius states only that the event took place on the old artificial lake (which would have been that of Augustus). Martial does not specify where the naumachiae took place, but he is clear that whatever location he is discussing could be flooded and drained at will:\\nIf you are here from a distant land, a late spectator for whom this was the first day of the sacred show, let not the naval warfare deceive you with its ships, and the water like to a sea: here but lately was land.

I’m an accountant with plans to move out and go for my masters after saving enough money.\\n\\n \\n\\nMy brother has a bit of a rough past so I’ll try to keep it short. About a decade ago, he attended a UC pursuing a major in Chemistry. He lied to our mother about his grades and he ended up dropping out due to his inability to keep them up. This left him with a big ass loan that needed to be paid off and no degree to show for it. At that point, he was forced to work retail. There, he developed a meth addiction and was diagnosed with depression. With years of AA meetings and constant support from our mother, he was able to stay sober for years and was able to find another retail job with better conditions. Fast forward a few years later, he’s traded his addiction to meth with an addiction to junk food. He's a head cashier now, but has no plans of either moving up in the position, or backing down to go back to school.  \\n \\n\\nMy brother and I used to be pretty close. During my college years, we would often bond, watch movies, and go out to eat. During the time however, I would notice things about him that would bother me. I was aware of his situation, so I tried to keep quiet in order to not upset him. One of them being that our mother would always do his laundry. He would also never clean up after himself. He’d never do the dishes. In fact, sometimes he’d just leave his dishes on the counter. He never did any chores either because he would always be too tired. He's extremely pessimistic and aloof about every single thing. He's also very prideful. Whenever my mother would try to offer some advice, he would straight up yell at her. He constantly complains about how tiring his job is and claims that one day he’ll quit or step down so he can go back to school despite showing absolutely zero signs of doing so. Whenever he’s home, 90% of the time he’s asleep. This kept up for about 4 years.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast year, I eventually snapped at him about his behavior. It became this full blown argument which ultimately ended with him calling me a condescending asshole. Since then, I’ve stopped communicating with him. This caused me to stop eating junk food with him. After a few weeks, I lost like 10 lbs alone just from not spending time with him. This motivated me to lose even more weight. It's been a year since I've stopped all communication with him. I’ve lost around 100 lbs. and I’m no longer obese or pre-diabetic. Our mother has always been worried about me and brother’s health so she's delighted with this change.

Semen or migrated sperm fractions were incubated with of 1 mmol of calcium, 5 mmol magnesium, and 10 mmol of creatine phosphate (n = 28) or in the presence of 4 mumol of Verapamil, calcium, and creatine phosphate (n = 10). The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995–96 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995–96 Atlanta Hawks season.  Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22–10 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback \\"a success.\\" While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnsons arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain.  Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \\"inexcusable.\\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53–29 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion 1995–96 Houston Rockets season, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris offense.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- Mori or Maori is an Eastern Polynesian language spoken by the Mori people, the indigenous population of New Zealand. Since 1987, it has been one of New Zealand's official languages. It is closely related to Cook Islands Mori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian.\\n\\n- New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").\\n\\n- Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.\\n\\n- The Auckland Region is one of the sixteen regions of New Zealand, named for the city of Auckland, the country's largest urban area.

Historically, they were experienced sailors and used stars to navigate during the night.\\n\\n- Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.\\n\\n- The Hauraki Gulf / Tkapa Moana is a coastal feature of the North Island of New Zealand.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Auckland Council . The western coastline of the ranges consists of cliffs exceeding 300 m ( 984 ft ) , interspersed infrequently with beaches . The rugged upstanding topography is formed from erosion - resistant ancient volcanic conglomerate and lava flows laid down in eruptions from the large Waitakere volcano to the west 12 -- 25 million years ago . The ranges are covered in native forest , most of which is in the process of regeneration since extensive logging and farming in the mid -- late 19th and early 20th centuries . In 1894 a group led by Sir Algernon Thomas ( the first professor of natural sciences at Auckland University College , now the University of Auckland ) persuaded the Auckland City Council to preserve 3,500 acres ( 14 km2 ) in the Nihotupu area of the ranges as a bush reserve .

After weeks of this, on Tuesday I asked her to please stop complaining about going home to me, because my Thanksgiving plans included working many long hard hours (work in a Bakery) up until the day, and then going home at about 1 pm to be in an empty apartment by myself. She replied “well, you could have asked me to stay back with you.” But I don’t really feel I could have. She told me she “always” planned on coming back on Saturday “just for your birthday.”\\n\\nMy birthday is on Saturday but I got off from work so i decided I take the train to our hometown tomorrow morning. she keeps texting me asking what my plans are. I’ve responded honestly, that I’d like to spend it with my parents and my brother, being with my dogs at home, and she’s welcome to join us, and to come over whenever if she’d like. I won’t really have gifts this year, and I don’t plan on making a big deal out of it. It’s just nice to have a weekend off from work. She’s acting as if I’m avoiding her or being rude, and not making a specific plan is inconvenient for her. I told her if she’s busy she can pick a time and maybe a place for lunch or something and I’ll meet her there. This only seemed to upset her more? My birthday was never a big discussion point before the laundry debacle. I think I’ve just made her feel guilty, which wasn’t my goal and I’ve told her that multiple times. But I don’t know if my behavior reflects that. \\n\\nTl;dr: my friend told me I’ve been bothering her. I apologized, and stepped back.

Passage 1:In 2009 Fertita along with Jack White on drums, Alison Mosshart on lead vocals, and Jack Lawrence on bass formed The Dead Weather. The group originally only intended to record a 7-inch single but plans changed and the band wrote and recorded their debut album in fifteen days. The band's debut album – Horehound – was released July 14, 2009 and was followed by a supporting tour. In October 2009 lead vocalist Mosshart confirmed that a second album was \\"halfway done\\". Later, White revealed in an interview that the band is hoping to have 20 to 25 songs ready for their Australian tour in March 2010. It was later confirmed that the first single from the new album – Sea of Cowards – would be called \\"Die by the Drop\\" which was released March 30. The Sea of Cowards Tour began on March 19, 2010, is ended on August 3, 2010. It included 42 shows over four legs.

He scored twice on his debut against Waterford United on 17 September, in a 4–0 win in the League of Ireland Shield. He went on to become a prominent member of the Rovers team that won the FAI Cup six times in a row during the 1960s. He, along with Pat Courtney, is a holder of the six in a row medals. During his career with Rovers he played over 300 games. His teammates at the club during this era included Liam Tuohy, Johnny Fullam, Pat Dunne, Bobby Gilbert, Mick Leech and Paddy Mulligan. During the 1965–66 season O'Neill scored 6 goals during the FAI Cup run including one in the final against Limerick. In 1967, he also scored a penalty in the final, a 3–2 win against St. Patrick's Athletic. He scored a further 2 goals during the 1968–69 Cup run. During the summer of 1967, O'Neill also played for Rovers when they competed as Boston Rovers in the United Soccer Association league. O'Neill also scored 2 goals for Rovers, one in each game, during a European Cup Winners Cup tie against CA Spora Luxembourg, helping them to an 8–2 aggregate win . In total he played 18 times in European competition.\\n Passage 3:Nueces is Spanish for \\"nuts\\", and refers to the pecan trees that grew along the banks of the Nueces River, noted by Spanish explorer Alonso De León in 1689. It is unclear when the name was given to the bay; it was called San Miguel Arcángel by Spanish captain Joaquín de Orobio y Basterra in 1747, and an 1835 map of Texas identified it as Papelote or \\"wastepaper\\" Bay. It appears to have been first noted on a Spanish map in 1527 as the mouth of the Río Escondido or hidden river, which is believed to be the Nueces. French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed into the bay in 1685, mistakenly believing it was the Mississippi River. Spanish colonial governor José de Escandón planned a villa on the mouth of the Nueces River named Villa de Vedoya. Fifty families were sent the site in 1749, but failed to establish a settlement, due to a lack of sufficient supplies. Later that century, missionaries discussed the possibility of moving Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission to the site, but decided against the idea due to conflict with the Lipan Apaches. Germans attempted to settle the same area, but were turned away by the French during the Pastry War in the 1830s. The next decade, a colony for freed slaves was proposed by abolitionist Benjamin Lundy, who had to cancel after the outbreak of the Texas Revolution.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks for the duration of the Texas Revolution.

Passage 1:The Eagles of the Empire series centres upon two main protagonists, Quintus Licinius Cato and Lucius Cornelius Macro, who are both Roman soldiers. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 AD. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced centurion and new optio, in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by Claudius as part of the Legio II Augusta. The 6th book The Eagle's Prophecy has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary Tiberius Claudius Narcissus. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of Crete, fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. The Blood Crows is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels.\\n Passage 2:Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Maeda clan were confirmed as daimyō of Kaga Domain, which included most of Etchū Province. Maeda Toshinaga, the son of Maeda Toshiba and second daimyō of Kaga Domain rebuilt the castle and temporarily used it as his retirement home until much of it burned down in 1609. His grandson, Maeda Toshitsugu was awarded a 100,000 koku holding in Etchū Province in 1639, the forming Toyama Domain; however, initially his fief did not include Toyama Castle. Unable to raise funds to build his own castle, in 1659 he reached an agreement with Kaga Domain to exchange some of holdings for Toyama Castle and the surrounding lands. In 1661, he received permission from the Tokugawa shogunate to rebuild the castle and to lay out a new castle town. His descendants ruled over Toyama from here until the Meiji Restoration. Many of the structures of the castle and its rampant were destroyed by the 1858 Hietsu earthquake, and most of what survived was destroyed by order of the new Meiji government in 1871.\\n Passage 3:One of the later signings of the summer was goalkeeper Len Hill, who joined from Queens Park Rangers in June 1925. Regular keeper Tommy Allen had turned down a new contract at the club, leading to the signing of Hill as his replacement. Allen later agreed to new terms in October and returned to his place as first-choice Southampton goalkeeper, with Hill making sporadic appearances later in the season. Transfer activity continued throughout the season. In December 1925 the club signed inside-forward Jim Swinden from Salisbury City, following a trial in which he scored two goals on his debut for the reserve side against Folkestone. In March 1926, right-half Bill Adams joined from Southern League side Guildford United. Needing money to purchase the freehold of The Dell, Southampton sold mainstay full-backs Fred Titmuss and Tom Parker in early 1926 – the former in February to Plymouth Argyle for £1,750; the latter in March to Arsenal for £3,250 – which \\"caused uproar amongst supporters\\".","target":"1","rationale":"The question asks for the age of Claudius at the start of the first book.

Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B.\\n\\nHint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.","target":"reservoir A","rationale":"The context states that reservoir A and B are both hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. The passage explains that because of low unemployment, there is a shortage of engineers to maintain the reservoirs.\\nAdditionally, it mentions that there was an engineer for reservoir A this year but not for reservoir B. This means no one regulates water levels or lets out water from reservoir  at the end of each season, making docks around lake more susceptible to damage by ice during winter months.\\nSo we know only   Reservoir has someone who knows how to regulate water level so would be least likely cause dock damaged ."},{"source":"Answer the question based on the following text.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nKate makes a machine that is very productive, and it gets work done quickly, because it uses force in amounts that are lesser or greater? \\n\\n\\nText:\\n\\nMachines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied.","target":"greater","rationale":"The text describes how machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, which means it uses an increased amount of force.\\nSo, according to this context (text), Kate's machine applies more (greater) force than would be used without a machine."},{"source":"Dark brown hair , pulled back in a ponytail that reached halfway down his back ; a small , neatly trimmed goatee around a mouth that seemed used to smiling quite often ; deep green eyes that looked real enough you could tell they were n't contacts ; and a nicely formed chin that neither looked too big or too small .

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates.

Passage:Arab traders have been visiting Philippines for nearly 2000 years for trade purposes, and traded extensively with local Malayan chiefs, datos and Rajahs that had various Rajahnates in the region. Arab and Persian traders passed by the Philippines, on their way to Guangzhou, China. These early Arab traders followed the pre-Islamic religions of Arabian Christianity, Paganism and Sabeanism. After the advent of Islam, in 1380, Karim ul’ Makhdum, the first Islamic missionary to reach the Sulu Archipelago, brought Islam to what is now the Philippines, first arriving in Jolo. Subsequent visits of Arab Muslim missionaries strengthened the Islamic faith in the Philippines, concentrating in the south and reaching as far north as Manila. Starting with the conquest of Malaysia by the Portuguese and Indonesia by the Dutch, the Philippines began to receive a number of Malaysian-Arab refugees including several Malaysian princes and displaced court advisors. Soon, vast sultanates were established overlapping the existing indigenous Filipino barangay (village) governing system and Indianized royalty. The two largest were the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which loosely governed most of southern Mindanao and the Sultanate of Sulu, which included Basilan, Jolo, and parts of Borneo. Several other smaller but famous sultanates were also established such as the sultanate of Lanao in Mindanao, which was later conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century. The ties between the sultanates in Mindanao remained economically and culturally close to Indonesia, Brunei, and Malaysia until the end of the 19th century when the sultanates were weakened by the Spanish and later the American militaries.\\n Links: a.

Passage 1:At the same time that Walter was developing submarine engines, he was also applying his ideas to rocketry. The high-pressure gas mixture created by the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide could not only be used in a turbine, but if simply directed out of a nozzle, created considerable thrust. Wernher von Braun's rocketry team working at Peenemünde expressed interest in Walter's ideas, and in 1936 began a programme of installing Walter rockets into aircraft. The experimental results obtained by von Braun created interest among Germany's aircraft manufacturers, including Heinkel and Messerschmitt, and in 1939, the Heinkel He 176 became the first aircraft to fly on liquid-fuelled rocket power alone. This type of engine went on to become the cornerstone of the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered fighter, when married to Alexander Lippisch's revolutionary airframe design. Throughout the course of World War II, Walter's aircraft engines became increasingly powerful and refined. The original design of simply decomposing hydrogen peroxide was soon changed to its use as an oxidizer (much like dinitrogen tetroxide would be used later) when combined with a hydrazine/methanol true rocket fuel designated C-Stoff, into the hot, high-pressure gases, and in later, never-deployed developments, a second, 400 kg (880 lb) thrust \\"cruising\\" combustion chamber, nicknamed a Marschofen, was added below the main chamber to allow for more precise control of the engine. Versions of this engine were intended to power a variety of aircraft design proposals and missile projects and was also licence-built in Japan (see HWK 109-509).\\n Passage 2:Impressing at non-league Halifax Town, he turned professional with Doncaster Rovers in 2005. Used sparingly in 2005–06, he was loaned out to Oxford United in March 2006, though did not make it onto the pitch. In 2006–07 he was loaned out to Darlington and Stafford Rangers, before he spent the 2007–08 campaign on loan at Halifax Town. In April 2008 he signed with Port Vale, and became a first team regular in 2008–09. He remained a key first team figure in 2009–10 and 2010–11, and was voted the club's Player of the Year in 2010. He continued to impress for the \\"Valiants\\", and earned a move up a division to Leyton Orient in May 2012. He returned to Port Vale on loan in March 2013, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012–13, before re-joining on a permanent basis in the summer. He signed with Shrewsbury Town in August 2014, before moving on to Carlisle United in January 2015. Six months later he signed for Altrincham before retiring in September 2015 due to a hip injury.

A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea.

We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said.

The western littoral between the Arakan Yoma and the Bay of Bengal remained politically fragmented even after Pagan's fall. The coast was divided between at least two power centres at Launggyet in the north and Sandoway  in the south. The weakness became exposed between 1373 and 1429 when the region was first subject first to Avan and then to Peguan interference. Arakan was Pegu's vassal from 1412 at least until Razadarit's death in 1421. The restoration came in 1429 when the last king of Arakan, Saw Mon III, in exile since 1406, came back with an army provided by Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah of Bengal.

Preincubation of maternal thyroid tissue slices for 2 h with excess iodide (30 microM) resulted in a 31% reduction in the subsequently measured thyroid-medium radioiodide concentration ratio. In contrast, similar iodide pretreatment had no significant effect on fetal iodide transport. In all other respects, fetal iodide transport, although it was 10 times higher, did not differ significantly from maternal transport activity. Combined radiolabeled maternal (125I) and fetal (131I) rabbit thyroid tissue was eluted on Sephadex G-25 columns. Fractions were analyzed for both 125I and 131I activity, and the maternal to fetal ratios (125I/131I) were determined for each fraction. The majority of iodoproteins eluted with the void volume, and the 125I/131I ratio was constant in these fractions. Thereafter, two peaks of elevated 125I/131I activity could be observed. Peak A eluted below lysozyme (Mr = 14,300) and above insulin (Mr = 6,000), with an apparent mol wt of 8,000 to 10,000. A second peak, peak B, eluted from the column at a site similar to that of MIT or a protein of Mr of 2,000. Ascending paper chromatography of this latter peak of 125I/131I activity and MIT was carried out in two solvent systems. In both systems, peak B comigrated with MIT. These findings suggest that the failure of fetal thyroid tissue to exhibit autoregulation may be associated with the reduced iodination of a compound with an approximate Mr of 8,000 to 10,000. The role of this substance in iodide transport remains to be identified. The reason for the apparent increase in the labeling of MIT observed in maternal vs. fetal tissue is unknown.","target":"Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate","rationale":"The abstract is primarily focused on the comparison of maternal and fetal rabbit thyroid glands with respect to their response to excess iodide in vitro.

Although oncologists are currently providing many cancer prevention and risk assessment services to their patients, economic barriers exist, including inadequate or lack of insurance, that may compromise uniform patient access to these services. Additionally, insufficient reimbursement for existing and developing interventions may discourage patient access to these services. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the medical society representing cancer specialists involved in patient care and clinical research, is committed to supporting oncologists in their wide-ranging involvement in cancer prevention. This statement on risk assessment and prevention counseling, although not intended to be a comprehensive overview of cancer prevention describes the current role of oncologists in risk assessment and prevention; provides examples of risk assessment and prevention activities that should be offered by oncologists; identifies potential opportunities for coordination between oncologists and primary care physicians in prevention education and coordination of care for cancer survivors; describes ASCO's involvement in education and training of oncologists regarding prevention; and proposes improvement in the payment environment to encourage patient access to these services..

His works include the Broadway plays A Few Good Men and The Farnsworth Invention; the television series Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, and The Newsroom; and the films A Few Good Men, The American President, Charlie Wilson's War, Moneyball, and Steve Jobs. For writing The Social Network, he won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, among other awards. He made his feature directorial debut in 2017 with Molly's Game, which he also wrote.\\n\\nSorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin that she was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.  In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for A Few Good Men to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal that was reportedly \\"well into six figures\\". Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin's one-act play Hidden in This Picture and found out Sorkin also had a play called A Few Good Men that was having Off Broadway readings. Brown produced A Few Good Men on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre. It starred Tom Hulce and was directed by Don Scardino. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.  Sorkin continued writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures and tried to interest them in making A Few Good Men into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film.

Have a look at pretty much any film fight where someone knows a martial art and compare that to someone who knows a martial art fighting for real. They are worlds apart. Even if you look at American Wrestling and BJJ you can see the difference. Knocking someone out with one punch is extremely difficult, especially if they are used to combat.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .\\n\\n- A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").\\n\\n- The romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the mass-market literary genre. Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an \\"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\\" There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction. Walter Scott defined the literary fiction form of romance as \\"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\\".\\n\\n- Jilly Cooper OBE (born 21 February 1937) is an English author. She began her career as a journalist and wrote numerous works of non-fiction before writing several romance novels, the first of which appeared in 1975. She is most famous for writing the \\"Rutshire Chronicles\\".\\n\\n- Rupert Edward Algernon Campbell-Black is a fictional character in the Rutshire Chronicles series of romance novels written by Jilly Cooper. He is the great-great-great-great-great-great grandson of Rupert Black (who married Miss Campbell). Campbell-Black's first appearance is in the novel \\"Riders\\", which follows the lives and loves of a group of horse riders and show-jumpers. Although initially portrayed as a brutish, womanizing, adulterous cad, Campbell-Black's character is later somewhat redeemed through his triumphant winning of an Olympic gold medal for Great Britain. His loyalty is also highlighted through his friendships with Billy Lloyd-Foxe, Ricky France-Lynch and Declan O'Hara, as well as his gentle courtship of his second wife Agatha 'Taggie' O'Hara. He has five children: Marcus and Tabitha from his marriage with Helen Macaulay, adopted children Xavier and Bianca with Taggie, and the illegitimate Perdita.\\n\\n- Self-publishing is the publication of any book or other media by its author without the involvement of an established publisher. A self-published physical book is said to have been privately printed. The author is in control of the entire process including, for a book, the design of the cover and interior, formats, price, distribution, marketing, and public relations. The authors can do it all themselves or may outsource some or all the work to companies which offer these services.\\n\\n- The Rutshire Chronicles is the name given to a series of romantic novels by Jilly Cooper. The stories tell tales of mainly British upper-class families, as well as the show-jumping and polo crowd, in numerous different sexually charged scenarios, often laced with adultery, illegitimate children, scandal, and sometimes, even death. They are linked by several recurring characters, chiefly Rupert Campbell-Black, and are set in the fictional English county of Rutshire, not to be confused with the real English county of Rutland. \\n\\n- Rivals is a novel by the English author Jilly Cooper . It is the second of the Rutshire Chronicles , a series of books set in the fictional English county of Rutshire .\\n\\n- A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\\n\\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\\n\\n- Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era.\\n\\n- An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.\\n\\n- A scandal can be broadly defined as an accusation or accusations that receive wide exposure. Generally there is a negative effect on the credibility of the person or organisation involved. Society is scandalised when it is made aware of blatant breaches of moral norms or legal requirements. In contemporary times, exposure is often made by mass media. Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust or the abuse of power. Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary or artistic but often spread from one realm into another. The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. \\nContemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and acts detrimental to their establishments. However, the possibility of scandal has always created a tension between society's efforts to reveal wrongdoing and its desire to cover them up.\\n\\n- A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.\\n\\n- Adultery (anglicised from Latin \\"adulterium\\") is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.\\n\\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\\n\\n- Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'rivals '.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- book\\n - christianity\\n - country\\n - design\\n - essays\\n - fantasy\\n - fiction\\n - horse\\n - information\\n - japanese\\n - judaism\\n - literary fiction\\n - marketing\\n - narrative\\n - news\\n - novel\\n - novella\\n - paranormal\\n - poetry\\n - prose\\n - renaissance\\n - romance\\n - romance novel\\n - romance novels\\n - romantic\\n - sexual\\n - society\\n - universe\\n - variety\\n - various\\n - video","target":"romance novel","rationale":"\\"Rivals\\", which is the subject, is a part of \\"the series of romantic novels by Jilly Cooper\\".

The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries.

They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.\\n\\nand a hint : Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which company's potatoes would be more iron deficient, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods?","target":"PepsiCo","rationale":"Kettle Foods does not use genetically modified potato seeds. Kettle foods uses non-GMO products for their customers, so it's likely that they are using traditional breeding practices to produce crops resistant to pests and of higher nutritional quality.

Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new \\"pure\\" painting in which the subject was vacated.

Bones. Bone density is important because bone tissue of lower-than-normal density is mechanically weaker and susceptible to breaking. The density of bone is, in part, related to the amount of calcium in one’s diet; people who have a diet deficient in calcium, which is an important component of bones, tend to have weaker bones. Dietary supplements or adding dairy products to the diet seems to help strengthen bones. As a group, women experience a decrease in bone density as they age. It has been estimated that fully half of women over age 50 suffer from excessive bone loss, a condition known as osteoporosis. Exact bone densities vary within the body, but for a healthy 30-year-old female, it is about 0.95–1.05 g/cm3. Osteoporosis is diagnosed if the bone density is below 0.6–0.7 g/cm3. Urine. The density of urine can be affected by a variety of medical conditions. Sufferers of diabetes insipidus produce an abnormally large volume of urine with a relatively low density. In another form of diabetes, called diabetes mellitus, there is excess glucose dissolved in the urine, so that the density of urine is abnormally high. The density of urine may also be abnormally high because of excess protein in the urine, which can be caused by congestive heart failure or certain renal (kidney) problems. Thus, a urine density test can provide clues to various kinds of health problems.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone.\\nThere may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle.\\nHowever, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more.\\nThe diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways.\\nRed meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten.\\nIt should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\\nThe Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.\\nLet’s look at some of the potential difficulties.\\n1. The diet can be expensive.\\nWhen you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.\\nBut . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.\\nQuestion: What can be the result of the Mediterranean diet?\\nAnswer:","target":"higher food costs","rationale":"The article mentions that the Mediterranean diet is not necessarily a good fit for everyone. One reason it may be difficult to follow this diet is due to its higher food costs compared with other diets. The writer notes that fish and fresh fruits are more expensive than fast foods, which tend to cost less but can also lead to health problems in the future.\\nSo, based on the context of what's being discussed about following a healthy lifestyle through the Mediterranean diet and how some people might find difficulty adapting this type of diet into their lives, one possible answer could be \\"higher food costs\\"."},{"source":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.

I don’t remember a life without her. In 7th and 8th grade we were best friends, attached at the hip. \\n\\nFreshman year we went to different high schools l, she developed anorexia and I developed depression. We didn’t talk for maybe two years because of wrongs we had both done. We started talking a little more frequently (and occasionally seeing each other) the last two years of high school. \\n\\nBetween our senior year and freshman year of college, I noticed she was really active politically with a side I do not agree with. I mean sure, she’s worn political attire before but it started to bother me. When Kavanaugh was elected to his position, she posted a picture of her TV screen (that showed him) with a caption that was literally just: “👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻”. As a survivor of sexual assault, that really hurt. \\n\\nI hadn’t talked to her at all the first semester of college. But two weeks ago, she made a social media post: her friend had died. I met this friend (Yolanda) once and followed her on Instagram. She was newly engaged and Beatrice and Yolanda met at an impatient anorexia recovery place. She was obviously crushed. I text Beatrice and ask if she wanted company, because of course I would want to be there for someone despite our differences. She declined but I brought over a pint of her favorite ice cream anyway and left.\\n\\nA few days ago she invited me to her house, which was supposed to be today. I was supposed to go over at 6pm. Well I got hit with a bunch of responsibilities/feelings really quickly: I have an awful family situation going on with an abusive mother, in danger of losing my health insurance, my new glasses aren’t the correct prescription, etc. I got home and it was too overwhelming for me. So, crying into my pillow I decided to cancel. Here is the conversation:\\n\\nMe: “I’m really overwhelmed tonight can I come over another time? 😭😭”\\n\\nBeatrice: “ugh ok- i wish i would’ve known earlier cause my friend wanted me to spend the night in *a town thats 45 minutes away* tonight”\\n\\nHer response sounded extremely apathetic to me. How would I know to plan my breakdown earlier in the day? I responded:\\n\\nMe: “I'm sorry that I had to cancel last minute, it happens sometimes. I just ask for your understanding that I had a lot going on” and she just ignored the text. \\n\\nSo overall, to me she’s turned into a really callous person. I was truly sorry to cancel on her last minute but it was only 5:50pm, she still could’ve gone and hung out with another friend. \\n\\nBut, AITA for wanting to call it quits over what is primarily political?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author of the post describes a situation in which they cancelled plans with their friend at the last minute. The friend had lost someone close to her and was likely dealing with grief. When the author had to cancel their plans, they felt that their friend's response was insensitive and apathetic.\\\\nCancelling plans can be frustrating for both parties, but it is important that friends are understanding of each other's needs and support each other when necessary. In this particular case, the friend is likely dealing with grief over losing a close loved one and might need more support than usual from others around them. Therefore, it would be insensitive for them to respond in an apathetic manner when a close friend has to cancel plans at such a difficult time.\\\\nBased on this analysis, responding in an apathetic manner would be considered unethical behavior here; therefore, \\"\\"RIGHT\\"\\" is the answer.\\""},{"source":"Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil.\\n\\nBro IR WOG la video upload panunga","target":"Not Hope Speech","rationale":"The given comment is a request for uploading a video.

One issue they report is that comparing the accuracy of off-the-shelf systems is difficult because of the different subset of languages supported by each system, which may also not fully cover the languages present in the target data. The authors choose to compare accuracy over the full set of languages, arguing that this best reflects the likely use-case of applying an off-the-shelf system to new data. They find that the best individual systems are , and , but that slightly higher accuracy can be attained by a simple voting-based ensemble classifier involving these three systems.\\n\\nIn addition to this, commercial or other closed-source language identifiers and language identifier services exist, of which we name a few.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively. In case of Game CoinCollector,  In CookingWorld, we compared models in the three settings mentioned earlier, namely, single, joint, and zero-shot. In all experiments, we measured the sum of the final scores of all the games and their trajectory length (number of steps). Table TABREF26 summarizes the results in these three settings. Phase 1 of Go-Explore on single games achieves a total score of 19,530 (sum over all games), which is very close to the maximum possible points (i.e. 19,882), with 47,562 steps. A winning trajectory was found in 4,279 out of the total of 4,440 games. This result confirms again that the exploration strategy of Go-Explore is effective in text-based games. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of the simple imitation learning policy trained using the extracted trajectories in phase 1 of Go-Explore in the three settings mentioned above. In this setting, each model is trained from scratch in each of the 4,440 games based on the trajectory found in phase 1 of Go-Explore (previous step). As shown in Table TABREF26, the LSTM-DQN BIBREF7, BIBREF8 approach without the use of admissible actions performs poorly. One explanation for this could be that it is difficult for this model to explore both language and game strategy at the same time; it is hard for the model to find a reward signal before it has learned to model language, since almost none of its actions will be admissible, and those reward signals are what is necessary in order to learn the language model. As we see in Table TABREF26, however, by using the admissible actions in the $\\\\epsilon $-greedy step the score achieved by the LSTM-DQN increases dramatically (+ADM row in Table TABREF26). DRRN BIBREF10 achieves a very high score, since it explicitly learns how to rank admissible actions (i.e. a much simpler task than generating text). Finally, our approach of using a Seq2Seq model trained on the single trajectory provided by phase 1 of Go-Explore achieves the highest score among all the methods, even though we do not use admissible actions in this phase. However, in this experiment the Seq2Seq model cannot perfectly replicate the provided trajectory and the total score that it achieves is in fact 9.4% lower compared to the total score achieved by phase 1 of Go-Explore. Figure FIGREF61 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows the score breakdown for each level and model, where we can see that the gap between our model and other methods increases as the games become harder in terms of skills needed. In this setting the 4,440 games are split into training, validation, and test games. The split is done randomly but in a way that different difficulty levels (recipes 1, 2 and 3), are represented with equal ratios in all the 3 splits, i.e. stratified by difficulty. As shown in Table TABREF26, the zero-shot performance of the RL baselines is poor, which could be attributed to the same reasons why RL baselines under-perform in the Joint case. Especially interesting is that the performance of DRRN is substantially lower than that of the Go-Explore Seq2Seq model, even though the DRRN model has access to the admissible actions at test time, while the Seq2Seq model (as well as the LSTM-DQN model) has to construct actions token-by-token from the entire vocabulary of 20,000 tokens. On the other hand, Go-Explore Seq2Seq shows promising results by solving almost half of the unseen games. Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games. \\n Question: How better does new approach behave than existing solutions?","target":"Extractive","rationale":"The question can be answered by looking at the information provided in the context.

He was a member of the Order of DeMolay as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports. He played baseball and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team.\\n\\nDuring a spring training game against the Chicago White Sox in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, Don Blasingame, pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and made the most of it. During another spring training game against the New York Yankees, Whitey Ford gave him the derisive nickname \\"Charlie Hustle\\" after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a walk. Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In Ken Burns' documentary Baseball, Mickey Mantle claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything.  Rose made his major league debut on April 8, 1963 (Opening Day) against the Pittsburgh Pirates and drew a walk in his first plate appearance. After going 0-for-11, Rose got his first Major League hit on April 13, a triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. He hit .273 for the year and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, collecting 17 of 20 votes.  Rose entered the US Army Reserves after the 1963 baseball season. He was assigned to Fort Knox for six months of active duty, which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. At Fort Knox, he was a platoon guide and graduated from United States Army Basic Training January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his Fort Thomas service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he could get out early enough to participate in local Reds games.

Greg remarks that for too long the ozone layer has been a hindrance to progress and that scientists need to work to eliminate it. Mark scoffs at his opponent and says that the only real way to make progress is to make the ozone layer even stronger, not hurt it.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Whose proposal will allow less ultraviolet light through the atmosphere?","target":"Mark","rationale":"The ozone layer is a part of the Earth's atmosphere that filters out UV light. If we were to eliminate this layer, more harmful radiation would reach us on the ground. Greg proposes eliminating the ozone layer while Mark wants to make it stronger which means less UV will get through with his proposal and only one answer is correct so Greg’s plan isn't it.\\nTo reiterate: The Ozone Layer lets in some sunlight but blocks other wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV) rays from getting through much like sunscreen or sunblock. Sunscreen works by reflecting away some of those dangerous rays instead of blocking them entirely though so without chemical assistance our skin gets damaged even if plenty of sun still shines upon us after applying protection because not enough radiation was blocked for full safety...but there are no problems"},{"source":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What naval destroyed is named after the first naval recipient of the Medal of Honor in World War II?","target":"USS \\"O'Hare\\"","rationale":"The question asks for a name of the naval destroyer, which is named after Lieutenant Commander William D.

Diffusion tensor imaging provides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent and nature of structural injury, but has been limited by examining only a subset of regions of interest (ROI) and by confounds common to the study of an elderly population, including comorbid vascular pathology. Furthermore, comprehensive correlation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements, including axial and radial diffusivity measurements, has not been demonstrated in the late life depression population.   \\n METHODS 51 depressed and 16 non-depressed, age- and cerebrovascular risk factor-matched elderly subjects underwent traditional anatomic T1 and T2 weight imaging, as well as DTI. The DTI data were skeletonized using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), and both regional and global analyses were performed.   \\n RESULTS Widespread structural abnormalities within white matter were detected in the LLD group, accounting for age, gender and education and matched for cerebrovascular risk factors and global T2 white matter hyperintensities (T2WMH). Regional differences were most prominent in uncinate and cingulate white matter and were generally characterized by an increase in radial diffusivity. Age-related changes particularly in the cingulate bundle were more advanced in individuals with LLD relative to controls. Regression analysis demonstrated significant correlations of regional fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity with five different neuropsychological factor scores. TBSS analysis demonstrated a greater extent of white matter abnormalities in LLD not responsive to treatment, as compared to controls.   \\n CONCLUSIONS White matter integrity is compromised in late life depression, largely manifested by increased radial diffusivity in specific regions, suggesting underlying myelin injury. A possible mechanism for underlying myelin injury is chronic white matter ischemia related to intrinsic cerebrovascular disease. In some regions such as the cingulate bundle, the white matter injury related to late life depression appears to be independent of and compounded by age-related changes. The correlations with neuropsychological testing indicate the essential effects of white matter injury on functional status. Lastly, response to treatment may depend on the extent of white matter injury, suggesting a need for intact functional networks.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the background of the study (\\"BACKGROUND Traditional T2 weighted MR imaging results are non-specific for the extent of underlying white matter structural abnormalities present in late life depression (LLD).\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

Permanent labeling of SVZ precursor cells with a lentiviral vector for green fluorescent protein did not reveal any migration from the SVZ into CA1 in the intact murine brain. However, in a nestin-GFP reporter mouse we found proliferating cells within the corpus callosum/alveus region expressing nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to precursor cells in the neighboring neurogenic region of the adult dentate gyrus. Within 3 weeks of BrdU administration, BrdU-positive nestin-GFP-expressing protoplasmic astrocytes emerged in CA1. Similar to precursor cells isolated from the dentate gyrus and the SVZ, nestin-GFP-expressing cells from corpus callosum/alveus were self-renewing and multipotent in vitro, whereas cells isolated from CA1 were not. Nestin-GFP-expressing cells in CA1 differentiated into postmitotic astrocytes characterized by S100beta expression. No new neurons were found in CA1. The number of nestin-GFP-expressing astrocytes in CA1 was increased by environmental enrichment. We conclude that astrogenesis in CA1 is influenced by environmental conditions.

Passage:Youth activism as a social phenomenon in the United States truly became defined in the mid- to late-nineteenth century when young people began forming labor strikes in response to their working conditions, wages, and hours. Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones organized the first youth activism in the U.S., marching 100,000 child miners from the coal mines of Pennsylvania to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in 1908. Youth newspaper carriers soon followed. These actions isolated youths' interests in the popular media of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts. This separation continued through the 1930s, when the American Youth Congress presented a \\"Bill of Youth Rights\\" to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee bring young people into larger movements for civil rights. All the way back in 1959, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. engaged youth activists in protesting against Bull Connor's racist law enforcement practices in Birmingham, Alabama. The youth activism of Tom Hayden, Keith Hefner and other 1960s youth laid a powerful precedent for modern youth activism. John Holt, Myles Horton and Paulo Freire were important in this period. Youthful life and expression defined this era.\\n Links: a. John Holt (educator) b. Pennsylvania c. Bull Connor d. Pennsylvania","target":"c","rationale":"The question asked for Bull Connor's title.

Favre threw to Peterson behind the line, but Peterson dodged a few players and got into the end zone, which made the game 7-0 in the 2nd quarter. The very next play, when the Vikings kicked off, Stephens-Howling returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown which tied the game.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her.\\nShe walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her.\\nShe left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away.\\nElmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off. If I need to be out for a day or two, Dr. Edwards can fill in for me.\\"\\n\\"Yeah, or if you need to take off a week for a trip to Hawaii with your beautiful new wife.\\" Carsie gave him a sexy smile.\\n\\"That's right.

This implies that when Macy went into the room, both Carsie and Elmo were present so we know she saw them together in person rather than just thinking or imagining them being together as she did earlier on when upstairs.\\nFor this reason the correct answer is option A - She saw Elmo and Carsie sitting in the Media room.\\""},{"source":"Today is not a good day.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current.

Anthony is best known as the former bass player for the hard rock band Van Halen. Anthony is known for his stage antics, his effects-laden live solos, his number of custom-made bass guitars, including a Jack Daniel's model shaped like a whiskey bottle, and his background vocals in Van Halen. He also has a signature Schecter Guitar Research bass-guitar series.\\n\\nAs early as 1996, rumors periodically surfaced that Anthony had been fired from Van Halen, despite claims to the contrary. He continued working with the band. These rumors persisted until his final departure after the 2004 reunion tour with Hagar.  Anthony's involvement in recording the 1998 album Van Halen III was dramatically less than previous albums. Anthony played bass on only three songs, with Eddie Van Halen playing the bass parts for the remainder. Anthony is credited as a songwriter for the album along with the rest of the band, as is always the case for Van Halen albums. Anthony performed with the band for the 1998 tour, and was credited on messages from the band thereafter. He participated in the band's three reunion efforts with David Lee Roth in 2000 and 2001. Anthony's name was also credited in a few band newsletters and appeared in band interviews during this time. Sometime after this, Anthony disappeared from public view until the 2004 reunion.  In interviews, Eddie and Alex Van Halen suggested they were jamming and writing/recording new material during this time period but appeared to be working without Anthony.  Anthony began periodic appearances with Sammy Hagar during his solo tours. He usually played as part of both the Waboritas and Los Tres Gusanos, two of Hagar's bands.

McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and Sheldon Brown returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown.

Eagles backup quarterback Michael Vick was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since 2002.

He later coached South Melbourne and Carlton and was an administrator at St Kilda. Stewart is one of only four men to win the Brownlow Medal three times. He was one of the first inductees into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and was elevated to Legend status the following year.\\n\\nJust months after his last game, Stewart took a punt by taking on the coaching job at the embattled wooden spooners, South Melbourne. He was lured to the job by ex-North Melbourne administrator, Ron Joseph, who was on a short-lived appointment at the club. The Swans were the worst performed team since the war, and their finances were beginning to spin out of control. Over two seasons, Stewart performed a minor miracle by hauling the team up to eighth in 1976 and then the following year the Swans made the finals for only the second time in 32 years. The thrilling campaign to make the 1977 finals was highlighted by a withering run in the last six weeks of the season and a bold stroke by Stewart. He switched Graham Teasdale (a forward struggling so badly that he was thinking about returning to a bush league) in to the ruck and Teasdale dominated to the extent that he won the Brownlow medal in a canter. The fairytale ended the next week when the Swans were crushed by Richmond in an elimination final. Surprisingly, Stewart now left the Lake Oval.  Carlton decided to replace their coach and wanted a big name to take over, so they immediately contacted Stewart. It was a fateful decision - Stewart's perfectionism did not always make him a great communicator and he fell out with a number of the Blues' key men. After a thrashing from Richmond in the opening round of 1978, matters went from bad to worse. Captain Robert Walls left for Fitzroy; his veteran teammate Peter Jones (who, like Stewart, had started his career with North Hobart) was relegated to the reserves; club favourite Adrian Gallagher was removed from his assistant coaching position. All three had crossed swords with the irascible coach.  Just a few weeks into the season, Stewart quit the club, citing a heart attack. Speculation was rife that he had actually suffered a nervous breakdown, a view that was supported by the fact that he had been charged by the police (under the name of Ian Cervi) for exposing himself to daytime shoppers in Glen Huntly Road, Elsternwick, when parked opposite the Elsternwick Post Office, but it is certain that he quit before he was sacked. Certainly, Stewart was fit enough to resume as South Melbourne coach in 1979. He could not modify his hard-driving style and the personality clashes continued, but overall he got the best out of the limited material available at South Melbourne.  In reality, Stewart's three-year stint with the Swans developed into a holding pattern for the team as the club flirted with, then agreed to, a move to Sydney. With the threat of liquidation constantly hovering over performances, Stewart got the club to a creditable sixth in 1980, but overall they lost more than they won in this period. Stewart's role as coach in 1981 was made all the more difficult when he had his driver's licence cancelled for two years, when he was found guilty of having driven dangerously, and having failed to stop after an accident. Stewart continued to give opportunities to young players and publicly backed the relocation, then handed the a player list in reasonable shape for the move, at the end of the 1981 season.\\n\\nWhen did he began coaching?","target":"Just months after his last game, Stewart took a punt by taking on the coaching job","rationale":"The second sentence of the context is: \\"Just months after his last game, Stewart took a punt by taking on the coaching job...\\"\\nThis states that Ian Harlow began coaching shortly after he had retired from playing."},{"source":"Given a prompt and four completions, select the completion that is the most plausible in continuing or answering the prompt.

It followed a long succession of conflicts between royalty and the great lords of the kingdom in the second half of the 15th century, subsequent to the formation of the League of the Public Weal. As part of these power struggles, in 1484-1485, Louis II of Orléans, supported by Francis II of Brittany and a certain number of lords, attempted to depose the regent, Anne de Beaujeu.

He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844.\\nIn Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.\\nIn 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

We characterized these cells using flow cytometry, epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, and transcriptional profiling (using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq). We used lineage tracing, transplantation studies, and parabiosis to show that most adult cardiac fibroblasts derive from the epicardium, a minority arises from endothelial cells, and a small fraction from Pax3-expressing cells.

Interestingly, proliferation rates of fibroblast subsets on injury were identical, and the relative abundance of each lineage remained the same after injury. The anatomic distribution of fibroblast lineages also remained unchanged after pressure overload.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson).

Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction.

Cell survival curves demonstrated a relative killing efficiency of 12:1 for violet compared to red light. Eighty joules of red light were required to produce 100% cell kill at an HpD concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, a level of HpD that has been quantitated in biopsies from patients receiving HpD photoradiation therapy. No difference in cellular killing efficiency was observed for power densities of red light varying from 10 to 100 mW/cm2. Cytotoxicity was directly related to O2 tension from 12 to 490 torr with a slight but consistent increase in cell kill at O2 tensions from 7 to 12 torr. Cytotoxicity was effectively quenched by beta-carotene, whereas mannitol had no effect, indicating that cytotoxicity is probably mediated via a mechanism involving singlet oxygen.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs\\n\\nGreg is is a chef.

Although some details were murky as the situation unfolded, a number of items related to the crisis were circulated worldwide via social media. The undisputed core of the public health crisis was summed up by the New York Times‘ report that “[h]igh levels of lead had leached from pipes into the water supply” in Flint in a period beginning around April 2014:  Among the items related to the water crisis that circulated online was a piece from the Free Thought Project titled “Flint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don’t Pay for City’s Poison Water”: There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem. However, the city’s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can’t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills … Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous. “Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,” [attorney Trachelle] Young added … Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government’s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill. The article confusingly vacillated between assertions supported by a largely undisputed chain of events (i.e., the water supply in Flint had been compromised for some time, and its effect on families was severe) with alarming but unsubstantiated claims (i.e., CPS was threatening to remove children affected by the crisis). The headline clearly stated that residents of Flint had been threatened with the intervention of Michigan’s Children’s Protective Services (CPS) agency if they refused to pay for water that was clearly not potable, but we were unable to locate any other account reporting on what would be an extraordinary scenario. The Free Thought Project excerpt reproduced above was the sole source for this otherwise uncited claim. A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michigan’s Department of Health & Human Services’ (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglect allows the inference that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children. Page 15 of a publicly available document titled “Mandated Reporters’ Resource Guide” [PDF] further describes scenarios under which mandated reporters are obligated to contact CPS and file a report. Appendix 2, Section I (physical neglect), portion A pertains to neglect with respect to living conditions: under a list of items by which mandated reporters can observe potential conditions of neglect, “running water in the home” is listed as a potential signifier. As such, the above-excerpted item quite possibly extrapolated its conclusion based on the existence of the Flint water crisis and demonstrated standards of child abuse and neglect evidenced by Michigan’s documentation of those criteria. If so, the item made a significant leap between something that could conceivably happen (children’s being removed from homes due to a lack of running water under normal circumstances) and something that might be far less likely to happen (CPS’ tasking itself with imposing upon the crisis in the city of Flint by using its scant resources to target families and children already burdened by an ongoing and unprecedented contamination of Flint’s water supply). We were unable to find any other reporting of such claims aside from ones citing The Free Thought Project, nor could we locate any independent, anecdotal reports claiming that CPS was removing children from homes “without running water” in Flint. We contacted several divisions of MDHHS to determine whether there was any truth to the claim that CPS has removed children for reasons directly related to the Flint water crisis, or whether any such information or demands had been transmitted to families in Flint with respect to the water crisis. Under normal circumstances, the lack of running water in a home could certainly serve as grounds to initiate an investigation or even trigger removal of children from their home until basic living conditions are restored to the satisfaction of agencies tasked with ensuring children are safe from abusive or neglectful homes. Given widespread coverage of the Flint water crisis and its ongoing nature, the assertion doesn’t make much plausible sense (nor does it seem likely CPS could have the manpower to engage in such a large undertaking). The existence of such a crisis in Flint and its effect on the city’s residents are not in dispute and reasonably warrant alarm, but unsupported claims exacerbating concern and anxiety are not helpful to the residents of Flint or other people seeking credible information about the extent of an ongoing public health incident. In response to our inquiry, a representative from Michigan’s Department of Health & Human Services confirmed children are not removed from homes solely due to a lack of running water (due to the current situation in Flint, or otherwise): We do not petition a court for removal solely because of lack of water. Instead CPS works to make sure the children have water – by having them apply for State Emergency Relief, or making sure they have access to water at a relatives’ home or bottled water. On 26 January 2016, MDHHS Children’s Services Agency provided us with a statement from executive director Steve Yager. Yager’s statement confirmed no such complaints or removals occurred due to the Flint water crisis: MDHHS has not assigned a single Children’s Protective Services complaint due to any issues related to Flint water. MDHHS works proactively to assist families whose water is shut off and to ensure families have water filters and bottled water in Flint. When a family is without water, our goal is to help that family provide clean water for their children. That can be through assisting families in applying for State Emergency Relief, setting up plans for children to access safe water at a relative’s home or providing bottled water. We do not petition the court to remove a child solely for the lack of water in a family’s home. We also contacted the author of the original The Free Thought Project article for additional information supporting the claim. He directed us to the above-quoted MDHHS guidelines, as well as the article’s embedded RT video. In that clip, a Flint resident speculated that refusal to pay water bills could result in the eventual removal of children due to a lack of running water in the home: Claim: Residents of Flint, Michigan have been threatened by CPS with removal of their children if they refuse to pay for contaminated water.","target":"0","rationale":"A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michigan’s Department of Health & Human Services’ (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglect allows the inference that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","target":"Jones","rationale":"The answer is Jones.

But bargains are not always what they seem.  Some sales and bargains are good deals, but not all are.  Here are some pointers to help you tell the difference between real bargains and bad deals.\\n   Sometimes a product is on sale for \\"below producer's cost\\".  Watch out for this kind of \\"bargain\\".  Why would anyone want to sell a product for less than it cost to make it?  Before buying, you should find out why it is being sold at a loss to the producer.  Is it damaged?  Is it out of style?  Does it come with any guarantee ?\\n   Another pointer is to read price tags on sale items carefully.  For example, a price tag in a store may say \\" regular price $16\\".  The regular price is the price of the item before the sales started and after the sale ends.  The regular price is only for that store, however.  In another store, the price could be lower.\\n   A price tag may also say \\"original  price $ 16\\".  That means at one time the item sold for $16 ------even as much as five years earlier!  For example, the original price of pocket calculators was high when they were introduced.  Now the price is much lower.  Showing the original price would be misleading.\\n   Finally, be careful how you use cents-off coupons .  A coupon can save you money only if you intend to use the item.  The price of an item may not be the same at different stores. So use the coupon at the store with the lowest price.  Don't forget to add any sales tax to the item before you figure out the \\"cents-off' price.\\nThe purpose of the author to write this article is   _  .\\nA) to show that there are no real bargains\\nB) to warn readers that some sales are not bargains\\nC) to sell a certain product\\nD) to warn readers not to spend money on bargains","target":"B","rationale":"The purpose of the article is to warn readers that some sales are not bargains.

Passage:In 1967 at the start of the governorship of Ronald Reagan one of Reagan's first actions was to fire Nelson from her state government post at the Consumer Counsel. Nelson said that this was because she was disliked by Reagan's supporters, including the California Grocer's Association and the California Manufacturers' Association. After this she became elected president of the Consumer Federation of California. She served also on the board of Consumers Union, and would be re-elected for a total of five three-year terms on that board. From 1969-1979 served as a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin. During this time she also served as a public governor for the American Stock Exchange. In 1968 after 15 years of work her lobbying had contributed to the passing of the Truth in Lending Act. She served two terms as president of the Consumer Federation of America from 1972-1982. She was the consumer consultant to the Office of Technology Assessment and the National Academy of Science. She petitioned the National Academy of Science to recognize the research showing saccharin as a cancer-causing agent and fluorocarbons as causing ozone depletion. In 1978 President Jimmy Carter appointed Nelson to the President's Export Council. Also in 1978 the American Council on Consumer Interests recognized her as a \\"Distinguished Fellow\\". In 1979 after the 1977 death of her husband Nelson returned to Mill Valley, California. There she was appointed to the Consumer Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the consumer advisory panel for Pacific Bell, and the San Francisco chapter of Consumer Action. At this time she said that her worst fear for the future was \\"That consumers will become like the feudal people of old times.

With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum.

But if you really listen to the music loudly, even really good music, it can hurt your hearing badly.\\nIf a person takes a subway to go from one place to the other for half an hour in the morning and a half an hour in the evening, and every day has to _ on his audio device because there is so much of noise of the train and everything around, and is listening to for one hour every day, his hearing is going to be hurt seriously in a few years, in a couple of years time, for sure.\\nThere can be many kinds of unsafe levels of sound. It depends on how loud the sound is and how long you listen to it. Unsafe can mean noise levels of 85 decibels for eight hours a day or 100 decibels for just 15 minutes.\\nThere are simple ways to protect people from unsafe sound levels. Young people who wear earplugs during concerts can enjoy music at 90 decibels as much as they can at 110 decibels. But earplugs may not look very cool. The fact that earplugs may look un-cool may be true today, but if there is nothing wrong with your hearing in the future may be true and wearing earplugs may actually be cool.\\nAnother common suggestion is to turn down the volume on your personal audio devices.

A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter.

He is best known for working alongside Declan Donnelly as part of the presenting duo Ant & Dec. McPartlin came to prominence, alongside Donnelly, in the children's drama series Byker Grove, with both men establishing successful careers as television presenters, in which they are most known for presenting SMTV Live (between 1998-2001), I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\\n\\nMcPartlin's first appearance on television was on the children's workshop programme Why Don't You?, but his big break came when he rose to prominence playing the character of PJ in the CBBC series Byker Grove. It was during his time on the programme that he first met Declan Donnelly, who was cast in the part of Duncan. The pair formed a close friendship on the programme, both socially and professionally, with the men performing as their characters until their departure from the programme in 1993. During their tenure, the pair created a number of hit records under the label of \\"PJ & Duncan AKA\\", including the song \\"Tonight I'm Free\\" that had been performed on Byker Grove.  From that part onwards, McPartlin and Donnely worked together on television, creating the presenting duo of Ant & Dec. Initially, the pair continued to work in children's television with the Saturday morning hit SMTV Live, before they eventually branched out into gameshows - Friends Like These, PokerFace and Push the Button - along with talent shows - Pop Idol, and Britain's Got Talent - and entertainment programmes - I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. The pair continued to maintain work in acting, starring in a tribute to The Likely Lads, in the form of a remake of an episode from the show's sequel Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? entitled \\"No Hiding Place\\". In 2006, McPartlin and Donnelly starred together in the film Alien Autopsy.  In 2007, it was discovered that two shows, Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, which he co-presented with Donnelly, had defrauded viewers participating in phone-ins. The latter was produced by the pair's own production company.

At 6 feet, 2 inches, the Indiana native was one of the larger players of his day and was known for his prominent handlebar mustache. He played as a right fielder in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Wolverines (1885-88), Philadelphia Phillies (1889-1898) and Detroit Tigers (1906). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.\\nContext: At age 36, Thompson played his last full season of professional baseball in 1896. His average dipped to .298, but he still managed to collect 100 RBIs. Thompson's throwing remained strong as he turned in one of the finest defensive performances of his career. Despite appearing in only 119 games in the outfield, he led the league in outfield fielding percentage (.974), outfield assists (28), and double plays from the outfield (11). One sports writer noted that, even at age 38, Thompson \\"possessed an arm that the fastest sprinters in the big league had a lot of respect for.\\" As a team, however, the Phillies fell to eighth place in the National League with a 62-68 record.  In 1897, at age 37, Thompson was sidelined by pain and appeared in only three games. Some accounts suggest that Thompson's absence from the lineup may have also been the result of his not getting along with Philadelphia's new manager George Stallings. Without Thompson, the 1897 Phillies dropped to 10th place with a 55-77 record.  Before the 1898 season began, Thompson gave an interview in which he questioned the Phillies chances to compete in 1898: \\"What are the Phillies' chances this season? Six clubs, Cincinnati Baltimore, Boston, New York, Cleveland and Brooklyn are bound to beat them, and they will have to fight hard to lead the second division, and I very much doubt if they can do that.\\" Though his loyalty to the Phillies was questioned, Thompson did return in 1898 and was batting .349 with 15 RBIs, five doubles, three triples, a home run after 14 games. However, Thompson opted to leave the team in May 1898 and return to his home in Detroit. His sudden retirement has been attributed to a \\"combination of homesickness and chronic back pain.\\" Other accounts indicate that continued tension with manager Stallings contributed to Thompson's decision to retire.\\nQuestion: What sport did he play?. Whats the answer?","target":"professional baseball","rationale":"The context is about a professional baseball player named Samuel Luther \\"Big Sam\\" Thompson.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.","target":"Lancelot-Grail Cycle","rationale":"This question is asking for the names of two cycles.

Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias.\\nContext: Ellington was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year. Then 66 years old, he joked: \\"Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn't want me to be famous too young.\\" In 1999 he was posthumously awarded a special Pulitzer Prize \\"commemorating the centennial year of his birth, in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.\\"  In September 1965, he premiered the first of his Sacred Concerts. He created a jazz Christian liturgy. Although the work received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. These generated controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion, though Ellington simply said it was \\"the most important thing I've done\\". The Steinway piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Like Haydn and Mozart, Ellington conducted his orchestra from the piano - he always played the keyboard parts when the Sacred Concerts were performed.  Despite his advancing age (he turned 65 in the spring of 1964), Ellington showed no sign of slowing down as he continued to make vital and innovative recordings, including The Far East Suite (1966), New Orleans Suite (1970), Latin American Suite (1972) and The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1971), much of it inspired by his world tours.

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.

It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army. \\n\\n- The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.\\n\\n- The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area.

The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.\\n\\n- The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.\\n\\n- Shanghai (\\": Zånhae\\" ), often abbreviated as Hu or Shen, is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.\\n\\n- The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.\\n\\n- The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people.

It is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.

The range's highest point is Orevada View Benchmark, 8,506 feet (2,593 m) above sea level, in Nevada. Disaster Peak, elevation 7,781 feet (2,372 m), is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains.\\nThe mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The southern end of the range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.\\nMost of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management.  There is very little human development in the remote region—cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses—but former mines at the McDermitt Caldera produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century. Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited. Vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands. Sage grouse and mountain chickadee are two bird species native to the range, and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits.\\nDespite the area's dry climate, a few year-round streams provide habitat for the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout. Fish populations in the Trout Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land-use conflict.

He is the oldest of four siblings; his father, Gilberto Enrique Pena del Mazo, was an electrical engineer; his mother, Maria del Perpetuo Socorro Ofelia Nieto Sanchez, a schoolteacher. He is the nephew of two former governors of the State of Mexico: on his mother's side, Arturo Montiel (whom business magazine Forbes listed in 2013, as one of the ten most corrupt Mexican politicians); on his father's, Alfredo del Mazo Gonzalez.\\n\\nWhile campaigning, Pena Nieto appointed a former general of the National Police of Colombia as his external advisor for public security, and boldly promised to reduce the murder rate in Mexico by 50% by the end of his six-year term. Critics of Pena Nieto's security strategy, however, said that he offered \\"little sense\\" in exactly how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Pena Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wondered whether he was holding back politically sensitive details or simply did not know how he would attempt to squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. United States officials were worried that the election of Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party may mean a return to the old PRI tactics of \\"corruption [and] backroom deals\\" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.  In 2012, the president-elect emphasized that he did not support the involvement or presence of armed United States agents in Mexico, but considered allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in counterinsurgency tactics. Beyond that, Pena Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the United States in Mexico.  The security policy of Pena Nieto has prioritized the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the previous six years during Felipe Calderon's administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments. The government of Calderon justified its position by stating that the violence in the country was a necessary stage in Mexico's drug war, as weakening criminal groups fought for territorial control against one another and the government.  On 13 December 2012, a law was approved that included far-reaching security reforms. Mexico's Interior Ministry, greatly strengthened by the bill, was made solely responsible for public security. Part of Pena Nieto's strategy consists of the creation of a national police of 40,000 members, known as a \\"gendarmerie\\". The Economist reported that the gendarmerie would have an initial strength of 10,000, but the Washington Office on Latin America reported that it was reduced to 5,000 members and would not be operational until July 2014. The Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion, along with a new task force dedicated to tracking missing persons.

His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours of France, five Tours of Italy, and a Tour of Spain), all of the five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, every major one-day race other than Paris-Tours, and extensive victories on the track. Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling.\\n\\nEdouard Louis Joseph Merckx was born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium on 17 June 1945 to Jules Merckx and Jenny Pittomvils. Merckx was the first-born of the family. In September 1946, the family moved to Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, in Brussels, Belgium in order to take over a grocery store that had been up for lease. In May 1948, Jenny gave birth to twins: a boy, Michel, and a girl, Micheline. As a child Eddy was hyperactive and was always playing outside.  Eddy was a competitive child and played several sports, including basketball, boxing, football, and table tennis. He even played lawn tennis for the local junior team. However, Merckx claimed he knew he wanted to be a cyclist at the age of four and that his first memory was a crash on his bike when he was the same age. Merckx began riding a bike at the age of three or four and would ride to school every day, beginning at age eight. Merckx would imitate his cycling idol Stan Ockers with his friends when they rode bikes together.  In summer 1961, Merckx bought his first racing license and competed in his first official race a month after he turned sixteen, coming in sixth place. He rode in twelve more races before winning his first, at Petit-Enghien, on 1 October 1961. In the winter following his first victory, he trained with former racer Felicien Vervaecke at the local velodrome. Merckx won his second victory on 11 March 1962 in a kermis race. Merckx competed in 55 races during the 1962 calendar year; as he devoted more time to cycling, his grades at school began to decline. After winning the Belgian amateur road race title, Merckx declined an offer from his school's headmaster to have his exams postponed, and dropped out of school. He finished the season with 23 victories to his name.  Merckx was selected for the men's road race at the 1964 Summer Olympics, where he finished in twelfth position. Later in the season, he won the amateur road race at the UCI Road World Championships in Sallanches, France. Merckx remained an amateur until April 1965, and finished his amateur career with eighty wins to his credit.  Merckx opened the 1967 campaign with two stage victories at the Giro di Sardegna. He followed these successes by entering Paris-Nice where he won the second stage and took the race lead. Two stages later, a teammate, Tom Simpson, attacked with several other riders on a climb and was nearly 20 minutes ahead of Merckx, who remained in a group behind. Merckx attacked two days later on a climb 70 km into the stage. He was able to establish a firm advantage, but obeyed orders from his manager to wait for the chasing Simpson. Merckx won the stage, while Simpson secured his overall victory.  On 18 March, Merckx started the Milan-San Remo and was seen as a 120-1 favorite to win the race. He attacked on the Capo Berta and again on the Poggio, leaving only Gianni Motta with him. The two slowed their pace and were joined by two more riders. Merckx won the four-man sprint to the finish. His next victory came in La Fleche Wallonne after he missed out on an early break, caught up to it, and attacked from it to win the race. On 20 May, he started the Giro d'Italia, his first Grand Tour. He won the twelfth and fourteenth stages en route to finishing ninth in the general classification.  He signed with Faema on 2 September for ten years worth 400,000 Belgian francs. He chose to switch over in order to be in complete control over the team he was racing for. In addition, he would not have to pay for various expenses that came with racing such as wheels and tires. The next day, Merckx started the men's road race at the 1967 UCI Road World Championships in Heerlen, Netherlands. The course consisted of ten laps of a circuit. Motta attacked on the first lap and was joined by Merckx and five other riders. The group thinned to five as they reached the finish line where Merckx was able to out-sprint Jan Janssen for first place. In doing so, he became the third rider to win the world road race amateur and professional titles. By winning the race he earned the right to wear the rainbow jersey as world champion.  Merckx entered the 1970 campaign nursing a case of mild tendonitis in his knee. His first major victory came in the Paris-Nice where he won the general classification, along with three stages. On 1 April, Merckx won the Gent-Wevelgem, followed by the Tour of Belgium - where he braved a snowy stage and followed the day up with a victory in the final time trial to secure the title - and the Paris-Roubaix. In the Paris-Roubaix, Merckx was battling a cold as the race began in heavy rain. He attacked thirty-one kilometers from the finish and went on to win by five minutes and twenty-one seconds, the largest margin of victory in the history of the race. The next weekend, Merckx attempted to race for teammate Joseph Bruyere in the La Fleche Wallonne; however, Bruyere was unable to keep pace with the leading riders, leaving Merckx to take the victory.  After the scandal at the previous year's Giro d'Italia, Merckx was unwilling to returning to the race in 1970. His entry to the race was contingent upon all doping controls be sent to a lab in Rome to be tested, rather than being tested at the finish like the year before. He started the race and won the second leg, but four days later showed signs of weakness with his knee as he was dropped twice while in the mountains. However the next day, Merckx attacked on the final climb into the city of Brentonico to win the stage and take the lead. He won the stage nine individual time trial by almost two minutes over the second-place finisher, expanding his lead significantly. Merckx didn't win another stage, but managed to expand his lead a little more before the race's conclusion.  Before beginning the Tour, Merckx won the men's road race at the Belgian National Road Race Championships. Merckx won the Tour's opening prologue to take the race's first race leader's yellow jersey. After losing the lead following the second stage, he won the sixth stage after forming a breakaway with Lucien Van Impe and regained the lead. After expanding his lead in the stage nine individual time trial, Merckx won the race's first true mountain stage, stage 10, and expanded his lead to five minutes in the general classification. Merckx won three of the five stages contested within the next four days, including a summit finish to Mont Ventoux, where upon finishing he was given oxygen. Merckx won two more stages, both individual time trials, and won the Tour by over twelve minutes. He finished the Tour with eight stage victories and won the mountains and combination classifications. The eight stage wins equaled the previous record for stage wins in a single Tour de France. Merckx also became the third to accomplish the feat of winning the Giro and Tour in the same calendar year.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why he was disqualified?","target":"Merckx won two more stages, both individual time trials, and won the Tour by over twelve minutes.","rationale":"The correct answer is: “Merckx won two more stages, both individual time trials, and won the Tour by over twelve minutes.”\\n\\nWhile reading the quote provided in this example it may seem like a perfectly good quotation of what happened to Merckx but taking a closer look at the paragraph's context we realize that Eddy Merckx was disqualified from his first cycling race when he was seven years old for taking part on a bike with one gear instead of three gears required by regulations.

Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.\\n\\nParagraph: Johnny has two old drums that used to carry nuclear in his garage. He is curious to know about any radiation that the drums are giving off so he purchases a Geiger counter and returns home. Upon returning home, he puts each drum in the opposite corner of his garage and then runs the Geiger counter over the barrel. Drum A causes Johnny's Geiger counter to make a slow but steady noise. When Johnny walks over to Drum B, his Geiger counter starts making rapid sounds.

Guyana's economy was based on conventional agriculture, while Nigeria attracted an enormous number of tourists to its splendid beaches each year.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich country caused more dead zones?\\n\\nHint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","target":"Guyana","rationale":"Based on the paragraph, Guyana had an economy based on conventional agriculture. This means that farmers in Guyana used fertilizers and pesticides to grow crops for export or sale. These chemicals were typically washed away by rain into rivers that then emptied out into oceans and seas. As these chemicals entered water bodies like estuaries, they caused a decrease in oxygen levels as well as other harmful effects such as algal blooms which further decreased oxygen levels resulting in hypoxia and dead zones where few marine life lived. Nigeria attracted many tourists each year but this did not impact their ocean environment directly through pollution from agricultural activities. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that Guyana would have been responsible for more dead zones than Nigeria"},{"source":"I have a new situation: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which ocean experiences less solidifying of hot molten rock?","target":"Arctic","rationale":"The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. This means that more new seafloor is created in the Pacific Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean by cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock.\\nTherefore, as compared to the Pacific Ocean, less mantle material undergoes partial melting due to adiabatic expansion at mid-oceanic ridges in Atlantic; hence, there is less volcanic activity and formation of new sea floor at these locations . Thus, we can conclude that \\"solidification\\" will be higher for the Arctic(Atlantic) ocean than it would be for other oceans like pacific or indian."},{"source":"Coming off their win over the Jaguars the Colts flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for an AFC duel with the Raiders.

The functional significance of this widespread noncoding transcription is mostly unknown.

Pol IVb/Pol V transcription requires the chromatin-remodeling protein DRD1 but is independent of siRNA biogenesis. However, Pol IVb/Pol V transcription and siRNA production are both required to silence transposons, suggesting that Pol IVb/Pol V generates RNAs or chromatin structures that serve as scaffolds for siRNA-mediated heterochromatin-forming complexes.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.\\n\\nParagraph: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which organism cellular respiration would not occur, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample B","rationale":"In the paragraph, Bob induced higher respiration rate in sample A and no respiration rate in sample B. Cellular respiration is a process that occurs inside cells to produce energy using oxygen as an electron acceptor. If there is no cellular respiration occurring within the organism (sample B), because its breathing has been stopped by Bob, then it would not be able to use glucose from food or other sources of carbon for growth/energy production.\\nTherefore, based on this context: \\n- Sample A will continue engaging with cellular respiration because its respiratory system was enhanced which allows more oxygen intake; therefore increasing chances of producing ATP molecules through catabolism(glucose breakdown).\\n- Sample B cannot do so since they are unable to breathe at all! No breathing means less chance"},{"source":"Multi-choice problem: Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true:\\n\\nA: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah.

The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil.

The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water.\\nHow is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand.\\nIs it true that a man who steps into quicksand is doomed to  die? No, for men have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic  that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become.

They have released seven studio albums and one split EP with Dead Swans to date.\\n\\nIn 2013, the band promoted Daybreaker further, primarily in the United States, first supporting Enter Shikari in the US in March with Crossfaith and then as part of the American Warped Tour 2013 in June.

Architects' final performance in support of Daybreaker is their first performance in India at the Saarang culture festival on 11 January 2014 with Romanian rock band Grimus.

Directed by Tom Welsh, the documentary is a story about Architects' Almost World Tour. The funding for the film was done as a community funded project on indiegogo. The band decided to release the film since they had left Century Media. After the target amount had been reached for the film Architects posted a song clip of a new song, \\"Black Blood\\", online. The band's split from Century Media was after their contract expired and due to \\"a daily occurrence\\" of falling out.

His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters.\\n\\nConacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series.  He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and $2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons.  Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team.  On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937.

In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the monarch, seated in front of a tapestry representing the Judgement of Solomon, wearing St. Edward's Crown, the robes of the Garter, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of \\"picture drawer in ordinary\\", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis\\". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of King's Painter, which was held in the 1660s by Sir Peter Lely alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on Van Dyck's pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist Samuel Pepys to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, \\"thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works\\".Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never received significant recognition from King Charles. However, at least one admirer thought he did deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the miniaturist Samuel Cooper had met Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned a portrait of the Duke of Albemarle from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure \\"Mairie Lady Hermistan\\" (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy.

Approaches that transfer information contained only in the final parameters of a source model will therefore struggle. Instead, transfer learning at at higher level of abstraction is needed. We propose Leap, a framework that achieves this by transferring knowledge across learning processes. We associate each task with a manifold on which the training process travels from initialization to final parameters and construct a meta-learning objective that minimizes the expected length of this path. Our framework leverages only information obtained during training and can be computed on the fly at negligible cost. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods, both in meta-learning and transfer learning, on a set of computer vision tasks.

At Topock, Arizona, about 300 miles (480 km) upstream from the Gulf, a maximum historical discharge of 384,000 cubic feet per second (10,900 m3/s) was recorded in 1884 and a minimum of 422 cubic feet per second (11.9 m3/s) was recorded in 1935.
