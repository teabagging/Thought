The 150-second piece follows a young soldier through enlistment, training, and battle as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST), analogous to a paratrooper that drops from space to a battlefield. The Life was created by advertising agency T.A.G., an offshoot of McCann Erickson. Production of the commercial itself was handled by production company Morton/Jankel/Zander (MJZ). It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum.

Passage:After publishing the plays Weekend (1968) and An Evening With Richard Nixon (1972) and the novel Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir (1970), Vidal concentrated upon the essay and developed two types of fiction. The first type is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics. About those historical novels, the critic Harold Bloom said that \\"Vidal's imagination of American politics ... is so powerful as to compel awe\\". The historical novels formed the seven-book series, Narratives of Empire: (i) Burr (1973), (ii) 1876 (1976), (iii) Lincoln (1984), (iv) Empire (1987), (v) Hollywood (1990), (vi) Washington, D.C. (1967) and (vii) The Golden Age (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the Axial Age (800–200 B.C.), with the novel Creation (1981). The novel was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; years later, Vidal restored the chapters to the text and re-published the novel Creation in 2002.\\n Links: a.

That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near.

The genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family Corylaceae. The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.\\n\\n- Hornbeams are hardwood trees in the flowering plant genus \\"Carpinus\\" in the birch family Betulaceae. The 3040 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.\\n\\n- Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\"\\n\\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).\\n\\n- The birch family, the Betulaceae, includes six genera of deciduous nut-bearing trees and shrubs, including the birches, alders, hazels, hornbeams, hazel-hornbeam, and hop-hornbeams numbering a total of 167 species. They are mostly natives of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species reaching the Southern Hemisphere in the Andes in South America. Their typical flowers are catkins and often appear before leaves.\\n\\n- Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.\\n\\n- BIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an unsupervised data mining algorithm used to perform hierarchical clustering over particularly large data-sets. An advantage of BIRCH is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric data points in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints). In most cases, BIRCH only requires a single scan of the database.\\n\\n- Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of .\\n\\n- In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.\\n\\n- Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\\n\\n- A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.\\n\\n- Alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants (Alnus) belonging to the birch family Betulaceae. The genus comprises about 35 species of monoecious trees and shrubs, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into Central America, as well as the northern and southern Andes.\\n\\n- Betula raddeana is a species of plant in the Betulaceae family . It is found in Georgia and Russia . It is threatened by habitat loss .\\n\\n- A eukaryote (or or ) is any organism whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed within membranes.\\nEukaryotes belong to the taxon Eukarya or Eukaryota. The defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have membrane-bound organelles, especially the nucleus, which contains the genetic material and is enclosed by the nuclear envelope. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek  (\\"eu\\", \\"well\\" or \\"true\\") and  (\\"karyon\\", \\"nut\\" or \\"kernel\\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes form multicellular organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types.\\n\\n- Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.\\n\\n- Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia.\\n\\n- The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.\\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia.

In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime.

Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles.\\n\\nWhich continent was inhabited by fewer tuataras?\\n\\nHint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...","target":"Africa","rationale":"The question states that Asia is mostly populated by reptiles, while Africa has very few.

He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.\\n\\nand a hint : There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : In which organism cellular respiration would occur, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample A","rationale":"According to the hint, respiratory rate correlates with energy use and reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism.

Greg remarks that for too long the ozone layer has been a hindrance to progress and that scientists need to work to eliminate it. Mark scoffs at his opponent and says that the only real way to make progress is to make the ozone layer even stronger, not hurt it.\\n\\nWhose proposal will allow less ultraviolet light through the atmosphere?\\n\\nHint: Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.","target":"Mark","rationale":"The ozone layer is a thin part of the atmosphere that has high concentrations of ozone, which partially protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American. During the early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state's population. In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%. Conversely large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[citation needed] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central Florida. Aside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the US south, there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South Florida area. In 2010, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians in the United States, with 2.0% (378,926) from Haitian ancestry, and 1.3% (236,950) Jamaican.

There was no difference in time to seroconversion between the patients who survived (n ‫؍‬ 14) and those who died (n ‫؍‬ 6). Although SARS CoV IgM was still detectable by IF tests with 8 of 11 patients at 7 months postinfection, the geometric mean titers dropped from 282 at 1 month postinfection to 19 at 7 months (P ‫؍‬ 0.001). In contrast, neutralizing antibody and SARS CoV IgGAM and IgG antibody titers remained stable over this period. The SARS CoV antibody response was sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting IF IgG antibody titers for human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63. There was no change in IF IgG titer for virus capsid antigen from the herpesvirus that was used as an unrelated control, Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, patients who had OC43 infections, and probably also 229E infections, without prior exposure to SARS CoV had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting virus but not for SARS CoV.

In 2014, during the final weeks of the campaign before he won re-election as governor, Walker was attacked in a TV ad by a national political action committee that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. And weeks before his White House run announcement on July 13, 2015, Walker was targeted twice: once in a TV ad by the nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group and once on a TV talk show by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, used her June 3, 2015 interview on MSNBC to cast Walker as out of step with other Republicans on abortion. After host Chris Hayes suggested that Walker’s support for a law banning abortion after 20 weeks was mainstream among Republicans, Baldwin agreed. But she drew a contrast, stating: \\"\\"Yes, but if you look at the history of those who have been elected president, Scott Walker's views are clearly more extreme than any Republican president in recent times -- much more extreme than President George W. Bush with regard to the issues of having exemptions that deal with the health and the life of the mother, and the issues of exemptions for rape victims and incest.\\"\\" On abortion, is Walker to the right of any recent Republican president? Previous claims Some statements about Walker and abortion have missed the mark, including the two we mentioned. The TV ad by EMILY’s List shortly before Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke in 2014 claimed Walker was \\"\\"forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion.\\"\\". A law Walker signed says women can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, though in certain cases a transvaginal probe may be medically necessary. The TV ad by NARAL Pro-Choice America, which aired in June 2015 in Iowa and New Hampshire, claimed Walker had said that \\"\\"forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.’ \\"\\" The \\"\\"cool\\"\\" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb. Nevertheless, there is no question that for decades -- going back to before his time as governor and as a state lawmaker -- Walker has been staunchly anti-abortion. Baldwin’s office didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her claim, and Walker’s campaign didn’t weigh in, either. But we can compare Walker’s public positions on abortion to those of recent GOP presidents. NARAL, Planned Parenthood We asked NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America about how they rate politicians on abortion rights. The groups told us they don’t produce ratings on a continuum. They put politicians into broad categories -- not on a scale that would rank one as more extreme, to use Baldwin’s term, than another. NARAL gave Walker and 13 other Republican presidential contenders a grade of F, for Fail. The group points to Walker’s votes in the Legislature and measures he has signed into law as governor restricting access to abortion services. Planned Parenthood rates the Republican and Democratic 2016 contenders more broadly, on access to abortion, affordable birth control and family planning. Like most of the other GOP hopefuls, Walker was given a red X on each measure, rather than a green checkmark. Planned Parenthood notes that besides wanting to ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, Walker tried to repeal a law requiring insurance companies to cover prescription birth control and defunded Planned Parenthood, which is something Walker himself highlights in his campaign speeches. The website of the National Right to Life Committee, meanwhile, highlights the records of President Barack Obama and his four most recent predecessors, dating back to the late Ronald Reagan, but doesn’t do any ratings. So let’s look more closely at Walker and the three most recent GOP presidents, dating back to Reagan. Walker vs. Bushes, Reagan Walker’s basic position is clear. In 2010, a week before he was elected to his first term as governor, we rated a claim that Walker wants to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. He acknowledged that was his position. As Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin told us, since then, Walker has not contradicted that position in words or actions. In fact, Walker has underscored his support for banning abortion without exceptions commonly accepted by other abortion opponents. In March 2015, Walker released an \\"\\"open letter on life,\\"\\" which began by noting that he had \\"\\"earned a 100 percent rating with pro-life groups in Wisconsin.\\"\\" And in June 2015, Walker pledged to sign legislation to ban abortions in Wisconsin after 20 weeks -- with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. That measure was passed by the Legislature the next month and is awaiting Walker’s signature. No recent Republican president has gone so far in opposing exceptions. As president, George H.W. Bush (1989-’93) and George W. Bush (2001-’09) both supported allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest, or to protect the life of the mother. The elder Bush said in 1992 he said: \\"\\"My own position on abortion is well-known and remains unchanged. I oppose abortion in all cases except rape or incest or where the life of the mother is at stake.\\"\\" The younger Bush declared in 2006: ''My position has always been three exceptions: rape, incest and the life of the mother.\\"\\" Meanwhile, Reagan (1981-’89), an idol of Walker’s, was closer to Walker’s position. He didn’t support an exception for rape or incest, but did support one to protect the life of the mother. In 1987, he promoted a bill with a provision that \\"\\"no funds appropriated by Congress shall be used to perform abortions, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\\"\\" Our rating Baldwin said Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive \\"\\"than any Republican president in recent times.\\"\\" Walker supports outlawing abortion in all circumstances. The three most recent GOP presidents each supported exceptions, such as allowing abortion to protect the life of the mother.\\" Claim: \\"Tammy Baldwin Says Scott Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive \\"\\"than any Republican president in recent times.\\"","target":"2","rationale":"In this case, the claim does not contradict the evidence present in the paragraph. Baldwin says that Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive than any other Republican president's in recent times. The evidence discussed in the paragraph also supports this claim by highlighting how Walker doesn't support any exceptions for abortions even in cases of rape or incest, unlike his predecessors. The overall tone of the paragraph is also supportive towards Baldwin's statement (given by how it discusses Walker's stand on abortions) and hence it can be said that there is no contradiction between them and thus we classify it as 2."},{"source":"This article: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\nAccording to legend, the lost civilization of Atlantis was located on or near what archipelago? \\nI was going to say \\"Portugal\\".

Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work!\\nIt was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation.

Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority...\\nBased on the previous passage, Why did some residents of Mobile Park Plaza decide to move? \\nIs \\"Because Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Yes, the answer because in this case is \\"Because Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park\\".\\nThe passage states that:\\n- The mobile home park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\n- In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close it effective November 30, 2001.  \\n\\n\\nBased on these statements from the passage and knowing what happen means (to cause [something] to occur), we can infer that some residents decided move after receiving word from Mr.Jennings about closing down their neighborhood/mobile homes since they felt like he was giving them no other option but to leave or find somewhere else to go before November 30th arrived.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis.

Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \\"nothing surprising\\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \\"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \\"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\\", aspiring \\"to be a serialized sequel\\" and proving \\"itself as a Saga\\". While noting that \\"[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\\", he had \\"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it.

Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: “One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.” Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: “Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg.” Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”\\n\\nWhich writer for the San Francisco Chronicle awarded Spectre with a perfect score?","target":"Mick LaSalle","rationale":"The context describes several critics' reviews for the movie, Spectre.

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than $34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another $215 million in gold and $2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations.

Despite another successful try-out with South American powerhouse River Plate, which he would later join in 1983, he chose to stay at his high school football team while completing his studies, winning five championships.  In his last year of high school, he received an offer from his hometown club Montevideo Wanderers and joined after graduating. In 1980, he debuted with the Wanderers first team, achieving their best position since their fourth and last national title in 1931, a second-place finish. His elegant behaviour and playing style earned him the nickname \\"El Principe\\", a nickname inherited from Hannibal Ciocca, a former Wanderers player. He developed the habit of chewing gum during games in order to avoid dryness in his mouth. He stated he became so dependent on the habit that he did not feel right when he did not have any gum before games.  In the Uruguayan Primera Division in 1981, Francescoli performed well for the team, which finished only behind Penarol and Nacional. In February 1982, he made his debut for the Uruguay national team. Later that year, he made his Copa Libertadores debut, ironically after his worst result with the Wanderers in the national championship, a fifth-place finish.  Vying for a place with his team in the 1983 Copa Libertadores, Francescoli and his team, which included other notable players such as Jorge Barrios, Luis Alberto Acosta, Raul Esnal and Ariel Krasouski, had a respectable season, finishing first in their group, tied with Nacional, and were only eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal play-off match.  After Francescoli won the 1983 Copa America with Uruguay, River Plate signed him later that year for $310,000. The following year, Francescoli was unable to show his potential, splitting time with other players. He saw more playing time towards the end of the season when the team reached the Argentine final, but was defeated 3-0 by Ferro Carril Oeste. Nevertheless, Francescoli, was voted the best South American footballer of 1984 for his performances for River Plate and the Uruguay national team, featuring alongside players such as Nelson Gutierrez and Antonio Alzamendi, among others. Eager to excel with River Plate, Enzo rejected an offer from America de Cali (later found to be funded by the Cali Cartel) which was doing well that year and would go on to become the Copa Libertadores runners-up between 1985 and 1987.  Although the team did not win the championship in 1985, Francescoli was voted Argentina's best player, the first foreign player to be given the honour. He finally won the Argentine title with River Plate the next season, claiming the 1985-86 Championship which had been re-established as a single tournament. He ended the season as top scorer with 25 goals, three of which came in a 5-4 victory against Argentinos Juniors for the championship match and qualified for the Copa Libertadores. In January 1986, he scored his most famous goal: a decisive bicycle kick which gave River Plate a victory over the Poland national team in a friendly tournament organized by the five largest Argentine clubs.  After winning the Argentine title, Francescoli represented Uruguay at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Uruguay were eliminated by Argentina, who subsequently won their next five matches to capture the World Cup. Francescoli later moved to Europe, signed by Racing Paris, newly promoted from the French Second Division. Nantes was willing to pay $2.5 million for his contract, but River Plate's president at the time, Hugo Santilli, believed Francescoli could fetch a better price.  Francescoli began his European career with Racing Paris in 1986, a long established team which had been in a slump since the 1950s and had recently started a rivalry with its growing neighbour, Paris Saint-Germain founded in 1970, which had won the French title the previous season. Automotive company Matra decided to sponsor the team, which resulted in the name being changed to Matra Racing in 1987. Seeking to dominate the 1993 Ligue 1, the domestic cups and qualify for the UEFA Champions League, automobile company magnate Jean-Luc Lagardere later provided funding to the club, allowing the team to sign footballers Luis Fernandez, Maxime Bossis, Thierry Tusseau, Pierre Littbarski, David Ginola, Sonny Silooy, Eugene Ekeke and Uruguayan Ruben Paz. In Francescoli's first season, the team managed to finish 13th overall in part due to Francescoli's 14 goals, which made him one of the league's top scorers that season.  Francescoli became a team idol and in 1987 was elected the best foreign player in France. For the 1987-88 season, Portuguese coach Artur Jorge, who had previously won the European Cup, was brought to the team. Francescoli would later describe Artur Jorge as the best coach he had worked with throughout his career. Matra Racing had been struggling to reach the top of the table, alternating between third and second place from the second half of the season onwards. However, after a series of matches, the team stood 11 points behind Monaco. Francescoli scored eight times in the league, finishing once again as the club's top scorer. During this period, he received an offer from Juventus due to the untimely retirement of its captain and star player Michel Platini in 1987, although Francescoli refused the offer. Francescoli finished the 1988-89 championship as the club's top scorer for the third consecutive season, and avoiding relegation.  The sub-par season of Matra Racing did not prevent Francescoli from being seen as a star worldwide. In March 1989, he earned a spot on the Uruguayan international team that played against the Brazil national team in an international friendly in Brazil that marked Zico's retirement, scoring one of his team's goals in a 2-1 victory. However, domestically he had suffered several disappointments and was frustrated by his team's lack of success in the Coupe de France.

Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\\n\\n- 793 Arizona is a minor planet orbiting the Sun that was discovered in 1907 by American businessman Percival Lowell .

Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band.

He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line.\\n\\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.  Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.  In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.  In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire.

For backstory I'm a 18YO (M) depressed, anxious guy, I finished HS 1 year ago, and took a year off (basically spent 2018 doing absolutelly nothing) I never had a job, umfortunally depression got the best of me I guess. Anyway, yesterday my uncle came here to make dinner (paarents were on vacation, only me and my grandmother home) so, he is there doing whatever, and I'm here, playing on my 3DS, on an online match. Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \\"dude, I'm cooking hurry\\" and I say \\"okay, lemme just--\\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \\"piece of shit\\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \\"obbeying\\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy. All I do is take out the trash and help my gramma as she cannot move very well. That is not to say that I'm ungratefull for what everyone offers me (home, food, internet), I never complain, and I rarelly spend money since I dont leave my house really. Also, I AM looking for a job, I'm just not lucky with that. Later on my grandma said that \\"we were both wrong because he hit me  but I also didn't obey\\". I got so pissed, I said \\"Look  HE was wrong, he came to THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE house and started giving orders to me, and then hit me.

The surface then re-radiates this energy back towards space in the infrared spectrum. This energy would escape and our planet would be as cold as the moon, were it not for the greenhouse gases (mainly CO2, ozone, methane, and water vapor). They absorb the infrared energy and radiate it back to earth, increasing the overall amount of radiation hitting the earth's surface, keeping it warm day and night.\\\\n\\\\nThat this takes place is clear and indisputable.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

We were never really that close just DM'd a few times.

I was already freaked out and anxious from the whole thing and I kept second guessing myself but I didn't want to give up. I also didn't want to leave the stuff in the rain so I tried the doors/windows just to leave it in a dry spot. The window was open so I just placed it down inside on top of an end table. I bought the most traditional fucking gift I possibly could have so I don't know how it could be perceived differently, I just got flowers and a small box of chocolates, and a small card that was supposed to be ironically funny (it was just like a get well soon card) that I wrote \\"I'm Back!\\" on the inside. I was planning on messaging her saying it was me at like 6, figured she would be back from work by then. \\n\\nFast forward a little bit that day, watching her instagram story she was NOT amused and definitely a little freaked out from what I could tell.

It would be reasonable for him to assume she would be happy about the gift, since it was meant in a non-romantic way (and it was just a traditional Valentine's Day gift). The guy also intended on messaging her later that day saying it was him so that she wouldn't be freaked out by an unexpected gift from someone unknown. Therefore, the guy did not know that his actions would make her feel uncomfortable or creeped out.

In 1958 the government replaced the Immigration Act's arbitrarily applied European language dictation test with an entry permit system, that reflected economic and skills criteria. In 1962, Menzies' Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and some in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen). In 1949 the Liberals appointed Dame Enid Lyons as the first woman to serve in an Australian Cabinet. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and concluded the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957 and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.\\"?","target":"Japan is whose biggest trading partner?","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"\\"Japan is whose biggest trading partner?\\"\\" as the answer is that:\\n\\n[Options]\\nNot Given\\n\\n */"},{"source":"WKKF \\"(102.3 FM)\\" - branded as Kiss 102.3 - is a Top 40 (CHR) station licensed to Ballston Spa, New York and serving the Capital District and Adirondacks.

In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich planet would travel shorter distance, Neptune or Earth?\\n\\nHint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:","target":"Earth","rationale":"The paragraph states that Neptune is farther from the sun than Earth and Mercury.

The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, identity confusion, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle. Therefore, this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood, and continues through the early to mid 20s. This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.\\nWhen does sensitization usually start?","target":"childhood","rationale":"The context states that Troiden proposed a four-stage model of the development of homosexual sexual identity.

The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre and was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied \\"I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows\\". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to \\"discuss the works, the themes, and melodies; ... The creation of an album has to be part of me or else I would not be able to interpret it, or sing in it\\".On 24 August 1992, Mexican newspaper El Siglo de Torreón reported that Miguel had begun collaborating with David Foster and Juan Carlos Calderón on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting cover versions for the album. He also received assistance from Cuban composer Rudy Pérez and Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, but decided to re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction.

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

Control rats with two kidneys were compared with unilaterally nephrectomized rats, and with one and one-third nephrectomized rats obtained by unilateral nephrectomy and infarction of one-third of the remaining kidney. Rats at each level of renal mass were maintained on chow containing either 6% or 40% protein content. Separate cohorts of rats were studied four and eight months after ablation and institution of these dietary regimens. At both time intervals and at all levels of renal mass, rats fed the high protein diet had higher average values for GFR than comparable animals fed the low protein chow. Within each of the dietary regimens the animals with loss of renal mass developed greater prevalences of sclerotic glomeruli by eight months. Furthermore, at each level of initial renal mass, rats eating the high protein diet had a greater prevalence of sclerotic glomeruli than those on the low protein diet. Similarly, rats on the high protein diet had greater rates of protein excretion than those on the low protein diet at each degree of ablation. The prevalence of sclerosed glomeruli increased between four and eight months in each group. Thus, the extent of renal injury as manifested by proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis was directly related to the degree of initial loss of renal mass, and dietary protein restriction retarded these manifestations of injury across a wide range of initial renal mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract discusses the effects of dietary protein on renal structure and function in rats.

Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader.\\n\\nWilliam entered the basement. Sophia entered the basement. The asparagus is in the red_pantry. Sophia exited the basement. William moved the asparagus to the green_cupboard. William exited the basement. Sophia entered the basement. Where was the asparagus at the beginning?","target":"red_pantry","rationale":"In the first sentence, William enters the basement. In the second sentence, Sophia also enters the basement. In the third sentence, it states that at this time \\"the asparagus is in the red_pantry\\". The fourth sentence states that Sophia has exited the basement. The fifth and sixth sentences state that William moved \\"the asparagus\\" to a different location (which we can assume is inside of his pantry or cupboard) and exits out of \\"the basement\\". In conclusion, we learn from earlier sentences of this story that \\"William\\" only moves around objects inside of his own pantry/or cupboard when he is in his own home (in this case 'basement'). Therefore, since William had not yet entered into Sophia's pantry/cupboards to move objects around at this point in time, we know for sure that William did not move any objects from one place to another when he was inside either Sophia's or his own house because there are no instances where he does so."},{"source":"Background: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians.

The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. Methods: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/ spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. Results: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ( adjusted OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36-3.00) and upper RTIs ( adjusted OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22-1.96).

The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]\\n\\nAn important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which company discharged more debt, company X or company Y?","target":"company X","rationale":"Company X filed for bankruptcy, meaning that it discharged its debt.

Here we show that in orpk mice, a model system for PKD that harbors a mutation in the gene that encodes the polaris protein, pancreatic defects start to occur at the end of gestation, with an initial expansion of the developing pancreatic ducts. Ductal dilation continues rapidly after birth and results in the formation of large, interconnected cysts. Expansion of pancreatic ducts is accompanied by apoptosis of neighboring acinar cells, whereas endocrine cell differentiation and islet formation appears to be unaffected. Polaris has been shown to co-localize with primary cilia, and these structures have been implicated in the formation of renal cysts. In the orpk pancreas, cilia numbers are reduced and cilia length is decreased. Expression of polycystin-2, a protein involved in PKD, is mislocalized in orpk mice. Furthermore, the cellular localization of beta-catenin, a protein involved in cell adhesion and Wnt signaling, is altered. Thus, polaris and primary cilia function are required for the maturation and maintenance of proper tissue organization in the pancreas. \\n Question: Which is the most common disease attributed to malfunction or absence of primary cilia?","target":"polycystic kidney disease (pkd)","rationale":"The most common disease attributed to malfunction or absence of primary cilia is polycystic kidney disease (pkd)."},{"source":"You are given a mathematical question described with a circumscribed mathematical vocabulary.

It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts.\\n\\n- Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (18321897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks  sometimes called \\"The Father of Plant Physiology\\".\\n\\n- The \\"Proteobacteria\\" are a major phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. The name of the phylum has never been validly published as no type genus has been proposed, thus it must be styled in quotation marks as the name has no standing in nomenclature. They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as \\"Escherichia\\", \\"Salmonella\\", \\"Vibrio\\", \\"Helicobacter\\", \\"Yersinia\\", and many other notable genera.\\nOthers are free-living (nonparasitic), and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation.\\n\\n- Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.\\n\\n- A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms. It is generally considered a field of biology, but intersects frequently with many other life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems.\\n\\n- Molecular biology concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis, as well as the regulation of these interactions. Writing in \\"Nature\\" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as:\\n\\n- Nucleotides are organic molecules that serve as the monomers, or subunits, of nucleic acids like DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). The building blocks of nucleic acids, nucleotides are composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. A nucleoside is a nitrogenuous base and a 5-carbon sugar. Thus a nucleoside plus a phosphate group yields a nucleotide. Nucleotides are also known as phosphate nucleotides.\\n\\n- The coding region of a gene, also known as the coding sequence or CDS (from coding DNA sequence), is that portion of a gene's DNA or RNA, composed of exons, that codes for protein. The region is bounded nearer the 5' end by a start codon and nearer the 3' end with a stop codon. The coding region in mRNA is bounded by the five prime untranslated region (5'-UTR) and the three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR), which are also parts of the exons. The CDS is that portion of an mRNA transcript that is translated by a ribosome.\\n\\n- Agar (pronounced ) or agar-agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from algae. It was discovered in the late 1650s or early 1660s by Mino Tarzaemon in Japan, where it is called \\"kanten\\".\\n\\n- In genomics and related disciplines, noncoding DNA sequences are components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs). Other functions of noncoding DNA include the transcriptional and translational regulation of protein-coding sequences, scaffold attachment regions, origins of DNA replication, centromeres and telomeres.\\n\\n- Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.\\n\\n- A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.\\n\\n- Sorangium cellulosum is a soil - dwelling Gram - negative bacterium of the group myxobacteria . It is motile and shows gliding motility . Under stressful conditions this motility , as in other myxobacteria , the cells congregate to form fruiting bodies and differentiate into myxospores . These congregating cells make isolation of pure culture and colony counts on agar medium difficult as the bacterium spread and colonies merge . It has an unusually - large genome of 13,033,779 base pairs , making it the largest bacterial genome sequenced to date by roughly 4 Mb.\\n\\n- Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.\\n\\n- An RNA virus is a virus that has RNA (ribonucleic acid) as its genetic material. This nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but may be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include Ebola hemorrhoragic fever, SARS, the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C, West Nile fever, polio and measles.\\n\\n- The myxobacteria (\\"slime bacteria\\") are a group of bacteria that predominantly live in the soil and feed on insoluble organic substances. The myxobacteria have very large genomes, relative to other bacteria, e.g. 910 million nucleotides. \\"Sorangium cellulosum\\" has the largest bacterial genome, at 13.0 million nucleotides. Myxobacteria are included among the delta group of proteobacteria, a large taxon of Gram-negative forms.\\n\\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'sorangium cellulosum' with the relationship of 'instance of'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- acid\\n - activity\\n - animal\\n - bacteria\\n - biology\\n - building\\n - chain\\n - colony\\n - complex\\n - culture\\n - degree\\n - dna\\n - dwelling\\n - five\\n - gene\\n - genetics\\n - genus\\n - giant\\n - infectious\\n - information\\n - material\\n - may\\n - merge\\n - molecular biology\\n - molecule\\n - name\\n - negative\\n - nomenclature\\n - number\\n - offspring\\n - organism\\n - phosphate\\n - plant\\n - protein\\n - range\\n - region\\n - regulation\\n - reproduction\\n - scale\\n - single\\n - soil\\n - standard\\n - system\\n - taxon\\n - term\\n - three\\n - transfer rna\\n - variation\\n - variety\\n - virus\\n - water\\n - writing","target":"taxon","rationale":"While there are many words in the paragraphs that could be used as answers, to determine which one is most relevant we must focus on the context of 'sorangium cellulosum'.\\n'Sorangium cellulosum', according to paragraph 12 and 15, is a soil - dwelling Gram - negative bacterium (bacteria) from group myxobacteria.

Various stories exist as to the reason for this distinct delivery. One is that the song began as a slow talking blues number without the stutter (in the 1970s it was sometimes performed as such, but with the stutter, as \`\`My Generation Blues''), but after being inspired by John Lee Hooker's \`\`Stuttering Blues,'' Townshend reworked the song into its present form. Another reason is that it was suggested to Daltrey that he stutter to sound like a British mod on speed. It is also proposed, albeit less frequently, that the stutter was introduced to give the group a framework for implying an expletive in the lyrics: \`\`Why don't you all fff... fade away!'' However, producer Shel Talmy insisted it was simply \`\`one of those happy accidents'' that he thought they should keep. Roger Daltrey has also commented that he had not rehearsed the song prior to the recording, was nervous, and he was unable to hear his own voice through the monitors. The stutter came about as he tried to fit the lyrics to the music as best he could, and the band decided it worked well enough to keep. The BBC initially refused to play \`\`My Generation'' because it did not want to offend people who stutter, but it reversed its decision after the song became more popular. \\n\\nHaving read that, I wonder did the lead singer of the who have a stutter?","target":"No","rationale":"A stutter is a speech disorder.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

He was educated in an academy at Newburyport, Massachusetts. He began his career as a businessman in Boston, Massachusetts. When not working, he studied at the Lowell Institute. He also studied with Albert Bierstadt, William Morris Hunt, and others. He attained noteworthy skill in making landscape studies from nature, and after 1858 devoted himself to the art as a profession. He opened a studio in Boston, and met with some success there. In 1868 he moved to New York City, and at the National Academy of Design that year he exhibited “Mill-Stream at Newburyport.” Soon afterward he began to use watercolors in preference to oils, and in 1873 was chosen a member of the American Watercolor Society. In the 1870s, he primarily did maritime themed paintings, with attention to watercolor paintings of landscape, marine, and coastwise scenery. He often spent summers in Grand Manan, where he produced such notable works as Morning at Grand Manan (1878).

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

Since these two endings clearly contradict each other, we can infer that there must be a slight modification to the initial context part of the story which explains why there is disagreement between Jenna's friends about her husband.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","target":"Diego","rationale":"The article mentions that the \\"Rokeby Venus\\" was painted by Diego Velasquez, combining two established poses for Venus - recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror.

These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983.

The family lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City) when he was still young. Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers.\\nContext: Keith had a public feud with the Dixie Chicks over the song \\"Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue\\", in 2003 as well as over comments they made about President George W. Bush on stage during a concert in London. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, Natalie Maines, publicly stated that Keith's song was \\"ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant\\". Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\" on the front at the Academy of Country Music Awards. While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness,\\" many, including host Vince Gill, took it to be a shot at Keith (\\"Fuck You Toby Keith\\"). In an October 2004 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she \\"thought that nobody would get it\\".  In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines \\"because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on\\". Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb. However, he continues to refuse to say Maines' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith's free speech.  In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote Al Gore's \\"We Campaign\\", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed.

The album gained large media attention, with notable magazines like Billboard and Wired covering the album shortly before its release.  Several months later, in late October 2017, the full In Between Dreams tour kicked off in Copenhagen, featuring the same cast and decorations as the Tokyo show, though with a substantially changed setlist that included preview tracks from an upcoming blues-styled album: \\"Die!

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nQuestion: When did the author became aware of Gilbert's plan?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA.

Moreover, moons around Jupiter are closer than black holes in deep space or surface of Saturn which make them easier to see with simple equipment like a reflecting telescope.

In the 10th century , two different groups claim to have taken the relics of an earlier Wilfrid from Ripon ; most likely one party took those of Wilfrid the Younger . The younger Wilfrid 's feast is attested in the Calendar of Winchcombe and later martyrologies , though he does not seem to have had a widespread or popular veneration .\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- The Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.) was a Northumbrian synod where King Oswiu of Northumbria ruled that his kingdom would calculate Easter and observe the monastic tonsure according to the customs of Rome, rather than the customs practised by Irish monks at Iona and its satellite institutions. The synod was summoned at Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey.\\n\\n- Wilfrid (originally spelled Wilfrith; c. 633  c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.\\n\\n- Ripon is a cathedral city in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure, the Laver and Skell. The city is noted for its main feature, Ripon Cathedral which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market. The city itself is just over 1,300 years old.\\n\\n- Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania.\\nArchaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.\\nDuring the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.\\n\\n- The Holy Island of Lindisfarne is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England. It is also known just as Holy Island. It constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland. Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD. It was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne. After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.\\n\\n- York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'date of death' with the subject 'wilfrid ii '.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - 100\\n - 1550\\n - 169\\n - 190\\n - 300\\n - 633\\n - 664\\n - 709\\n - 800","target":"800","rationale":"Wilfrid (II) or Wilfrith (II).

With an altitude variance of over 7,000 ft (2,100 m), the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant.

In many developing countries paraquat is widely available and inexpensive, making poisoning prevention difficult. However most of the people who become poisoned from paraquat have taken it as a means of suicide. Standard treatment for paraquat poisoning both prevents further absorption and reduces the load of paraquat in the blood through haemoperfusion or haemodialysis. The effectiveness of standard treatments is extremely limited. The immune system plays an important role in exacerbating paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. Immunosuppressive treatment using glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide in combination is being developed and studied.   \\n OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide on mortality in patients with paraquat-induced lung fibrosis.    SEARCH METHODS To identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic, we searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (searched 1 February 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1946 January Week 3 2012), EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1947 to Week 4 2012), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to January 2012), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to January 2012), Chinese Biomedical Literature and Retrieval System (CBM) (1978 to April 2012), Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC) (1995 to April 2012), and Chinese Medical Academic Conference (CMAC) (1994 to April 2012). Searches were completed on English language databases on 1 February 2012 and on Chinese language databases on 12 April 2012.    SELECTION CRITERIA RCTs were included in this review. All patients were to receive standard care, plus the intervention or control. The intervention was glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide in combination versus a control of a placebo, standard care alone or any other therapy in addition to standard care.   \\n DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The mortality risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each study on an intention-to-treat basis. Data for all-cause mortality at final follow-up were summarised in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.   \\n MAIN RESULTS This systematic review includes three trials with a combined total of 164 participants who had moderate to severe paraquat poisoning. Patients who received glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care had a lower risk of death at final follow-up than those receiving standard care only (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89).    AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of three small RCTs of moderate to severely poisoned patients, glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may be a beneficial treatment for patients with paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. To enable further study of the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide for patients with moderate to severe paraquat poisoning, hospitals may provide this treatment as part of an RCT with allocation concealment.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the background of the study (\\"BACKGROUND Paraquat is an effective and widely used herbicide but is also a lethal poison.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the objectives, search methods, selection criteria, and main results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the authors' conclusions.

This study followed the treatment progress of 20 patients for a mean of 39 months after intake. The study included a detailed history, neurological examination, and psychological testing on each patient. At follow-up each patient was interviewed and a questionnaire was completed by his or her therapist to assess treatment response. Although nine patients achieved partial or full integration, complete integration was maintained by only five. During therapy the unintegrated patients experienced emotional trauma at approximately twice the rate as did the patients who eventually became integrated. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and hypnosis were the most widely prescribed therapies. The improvement in multiple personality appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion from acceptance of the diagnosis to integration. The progress of therapy was hindered most commonly by the overuse of the mental mechanisms of repression and denial, the continued utilization of secrecy, which began during child abuse, and the production of numerous crises. The most common countertransferences included anger, exasperation, and emotional exhaustion. Although the psychotherapy of patients with multiple personality is tedious and time consuming, it can be eminently successful if the patient and therapist persevere. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenosine Triphosphate 2)Animal 3)Cell Line","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract discusses the progress of therapy for patients with multiple personality disorder and the factors that affect their treatment outcomes.

In this work, we present a probabilistic training method for Neural Network with both binary weights and activations, called PBNet. By embracing stochasticity during training, we circumvent the need to approximate the gradient of functions for which the derivative is zero almost always, such as $\\\\textrm{sign}(\\\\cdot)$, while still obtaining a fully Binary Neural Network at test time. Moreover, it allows for anytime ensemble predictions for improved performance and uncertainty estimates by sampling from the weight distribution. Since all operations in a layer of the PBNet operate on random variables, we introduce stochastic versions of Batch Normalization and max pooling, which transfer well to a deterministic network at test time.   We evaluate two related training methods for the PBNet: one in which activation distributions are propagated throughout the network, and one in which binary activations are sampled in each layer. Our experiments indicate that sampling the binary activations is an important element for stochastic training of binary Neural Networks.","target":"We introduce a stochastic training method for training Binary Neural Network with both binary weights and activations","rationale":"A short summary of the abstract: \\"We introduce a stochastic training method for training Binary Neural Network with both binary weights and activations\\"."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- The action at La Hogue occurred during the pursuit of the French fleet after the Battle of Barfleur on 19 May Old Style ( 29 May ( New Style ) ) , 1692 , during the Nine Years ' War .

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\".

While historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to Lake Forest to discourage his interest in jazz, others believe that he may have been sent away in response to his arrest. Regardless, Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both the faculty attention and discipline required to improve his academic performance, necessitated by the fact that Bix had failed most courses at High School, remaining a junior in 1921 despite turning 18 in March of that year. His interests, however, remained limited to music and sports. In pursuit of the former, Beiderbecke often visited Chicago to listen to jazz bands at night clubs and speakeasies, including the infamous Friar's Inn, where he sometimes sat in with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He also traveled to the predominantly African-American South Side to listen to classic black jazz bands such as King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, which featured Louis Armstrong on second cornet. \\"Don't think I'm getting hard, Burnie,\\" he wrote to his brother, \\"but I'd go to hell to hear a good band.\\" On campus, he helped organize the Cy-Bix Orchestra with drummer Walter \\"Cy\\" Welge and almost immediately got into trouble with the Lake Forest headmaster for performing indecorously at a school dance.\\nBeiderbecke often failed to return to his dormitory before curfew, and sometimes stayed off-campus the next day. In the early morning hours of May 20, 1922, he was caught on the fire escape to his dormitory, attempting to climb back into his room. The faculty voted to expel him the next day, due both to his academic failings and his extracurricular activities, which included drinking. The headmaster informed Beiderbecke's parents by letter that following his expulsion school officials confirmed that Beiderbecke \\"was drinking himself and was responsible, in part at least, in having liquor brought..., can you guess it ?","target":"Bix","rationale":"The context of the passage is describing Beiderbecke's experience at boarding school.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: David was visiting Japan.

A city with no radiation would not cause anything inside of a Geiger counter to change, as it wouldn't produce any electrical current and thus no clicks could be heard.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said. \\n\\nQuestion: What did Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledge to do after conceding defeat in parliamentary elections\\nI found this answer \\"Pledge to fight for reelection\\".

There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.","target":"Spring","rationale":"At the end of the 2 year test period, Clark county had better results.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.\\n\\nActivation of the mammalian Notch receptor after ligand binding relies on a succession of events including metalloprotease-cleavage, endocytosis, monoubiquitination, and eventually processing by the gamma-secretase, giving rise to a soluble, transcriptionally active molecule. The Notch1 receptor was proposed to be monoubiquitinated before its gamma-secretase cleavage; the targeted lysine has been localized to its submembrane domain. Investigating how this step might be regulated by a deubiquitinase (DUB) activity will provide new insight for understanding Notch receptor activation and downstream signaling. An immunofluorescence-based screening of an shRNA library allowed us to identify eIF3f, previously known as one of the subunits of the translation initiation factor eIF3, as a DUB targeting the activated Notch receptor. We show that eIF3f has an intrinsic DUB activity. Knocking down eIF3f leads to an accumulation of monoubiquitinated forms of activated Notch, an effect counteracted by murine WT eIF3f but not by a catalytically inactive mutant. We also show that eIF3f is recruited to activated Notch on endocytic vesicles by the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex1, which serves as a bridging factor. Finally, catalytically inactive forms of eIF3f as well as shRNAs targeting eIF3f repress Notch activation in a coculture assay, showing that eIF3f is a new positive regulator of the Notch pathway. Our results support two new and provocative conclusions: (1) The activated form of Notch needs to be deubiquitinated before being processed by the gamma-secretase activity and entering the nucleus, where it fulfills its transcriptional function. (2) The enzyme accounting for this deubiquitinase activity is eIF3f, known so far as a translation initiation factor. These data improve our knowledge of Notch signaling but also open new avenues of research on the Zomes family and the translation initiation factors.","target":"The Translation Initiation Factor 3f (eIF3f) Exhibits a Deubiquitinase Activity Regulating Notch Activation","rationale":"A proper title should describe the main idea of the study and highlight its findings.

This unanticipated reemergence is ironic, given that polioviruses, once the major causes of AFM, are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead, the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68, until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic, virologic, and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral disease emergence. \\n Title: Acute Flaccid Myelitis: Something Old and Something New","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph describes the global reemergence of AFM, which has been linked to a resurgence in non-polio enteroviruses.

In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating  in zero gravity .\\nHowever, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.\\nOf course, astronauts can still produce tears . But crying is much more difficult in space, according to The Atlantic  in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow  down out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go -- they just stick  to your eyes.\\nIn May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. \\"Tears,\\" he said, \\"don't fall off of your eyes. They just stay there.\\"\\nBesides making your vision  unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case  in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. \\"My right eye is stinging  like crazy,\\" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.\\nSince gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of  the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe  the tears away. Another choice is to just wait -- \\"When the tears get big enough, they simply break free of the eyes and float around,\\" astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.\\nThere are lots of small things -- things like crying -- that we are so used to on Earth. We usually _ until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up  everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.\\nTherefore,...\\nQuestion: What effect do tears have on astronauts?\\nOptions: A: They cause physical pain.\\nB: They bring comfort to them.\\nC: They make their vision clearer.\\nD: They float around and cause trouble.","target":"A","rationale":"In the conversation between two people, Bob and Dan, they are discussing how it is not possible to cry in zero gravity.\\nBob states that tears do not fall out of an astronaut's eyes like they would on earth due to a lack of gravity.

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian  ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- Startin' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville.

Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol.\\n\\nWhich friend doesn't take an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase?\\n\\nHint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.","target":"Henry","rationale":"Brad has very high levels of cholesterol, so he would likely be taking a statin to help lower his cholesterol.

Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\\n\\nParagraph: Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures.

Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

At the same time, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century. On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished, and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone. To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish-Venetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under nominal Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped any claim on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece. Following the fall of Candia, fears rose that the Ottomans would attack Malta. In 1670, the Order of St. John began to improve the island's defences with the construction of the Cottonera Lines and Fort Ricasoli.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Passage:He was born in Montluel, in the département of Ain, France, 19 December 1799. He lived at St. Paul, Minnesota, 22 February 1857. He made his preparatory studies in the Petits séminaires of Meximieux (Ain) and Saint-Genis-l'Argentière (Rhône), his studies of philosophy at Alix (Rhône), and of theology in the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. He was ordained priest 20 December 1823, and soon was appointed vicar in the parish at Ferney, once the home of Voltaire, and eventually became its parish priest. He built there a new church and founded a boys' college with funds gathered on a tour through France. At this period, he revived the Catholic faith among many indifferent parishioners, who were made indifferent by the surviving influence of Descartes, and the proximity of the Protestant cantons of Switzerland. But Crétin longed for a larger field of activity; at one time he thought earnestly of going as a missionary to China. His perplexities in that regard were solved by the advent of Bishop Mathias Loras, first bishop of Dubuque, Iowa, who arrived in France in 1838 in search of priests for to evangelize his vast diocese. Crétin was one of the few who volunteered and on 16 August 1838, he secretly left his parish, embarked at Le Havre with Bishop Loras, and landed in New York in October of the same year. The winter of 1838-39 was spent in St. Louis, Missouri, and on his arrival in Dubuque, 18 April 1839, he was immediately appointed vicar-general of the new diocese. For over eleven years, he exercised his priestly ministry in these new regions, dividing his time between Dubuque, Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and the Winnebago Indians in the neighborhood of Fort Atkinson, in Winneshiek County, Iowa. Only once, in 1847, did he absent himself, when he made a trip to Europe in the interest of his missions. In 1850 St. Paul, Minnesota became the seat of a new diocese. Crétin was appointed its first bishop, and went to France, to be consecrated, 26 January 1851, at Belley by Bishop Devie, who had ordained him to the priesthood.\\n Links: a. Parish b. France c.

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".\\n\\n- Tripe is a type of edible lining from the stomachs of various farm animals.

The \\"heart\\" sweetbreads are more spherical in shape, and surrounded symmetrically by the \\"throat\\" sweetbreads, which are more cylindrical in shape.\\n\\n- Ruminants are mammals that are able to acquire nutrients from plant-based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion, principally through microbial actions. The process typically requires the fermented ingesta (known as cud) to be regurgitated and chewed again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called rumination. The word \\"ruminant\\" comes from the Latin \\"ruminare\\", which means \\"to chew over again\\".\\n\\n- Ovis is a genus of mammals, part of the goat-antelope subfamily of the ruminant family Bovidae.

The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).\\n\\n- The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.\\n\\n- Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.\\n\\n- Tripoux ( or Tripous ) is a dish made with small bundles of sheep tripe , usually stuffed with sheep 's feet , sweetbreads and various herbs and garden vegetables .

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. Tom Brady made his 200th career regular season start. On the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route,  and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, Geno Smith hit Jeremy Kerley for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard Oday Aboushi was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from Nick Folk. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7-6. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9-7. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14-12. A crucial pass-interference penalty on Asher Allen on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-12 lead at halftime.  On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with Chris Ivory scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19-17. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20-19 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found Danny Amendola for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27-19. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. Geno Smith engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end Jeff Cumberland for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27-25. Amendola recovered the onside kick, but the Jets defense stepped up, preventing the Patriots from running out the clock, giving the Jets one last chance at an upset with 1:06 remaining. Starting at their own 31, Geno Smith hit David Nelson for 11 yards to the Jets 42. Next, completing a pass to Jeremy Kerley for 13 to the Patriots 45. Chris Ivory ran for five yards before heading out of bounds at the Patriots 40. After an incomplete pass, Folk came on to attempt the game-winning 58-yard field with 0:05 seconds left, but the kick was blocked by defensive lineman Chris Jones, who had been called for a personal foul on a field goal attempt against the Jets the previous season which led to Folk's game winning 42-yard field goal, and the Patriots escaped with their third win in a row. Though not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing  20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end Chandler Jones injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Jets ran for 218 yards on the night, led by Chris Ivory, who continued to be a pest to the Patriots, gaining 107 yards on 21 carries. Chris Johnson added 61 yards on 13 carries.The Jets out-gained the Patriots 423-323 and absolutely controlled the clock winning T.O.P. 40:54-19:06, but the Patriots defense tightened down when it mattered.\\n\\nWhich quarterback threw more touchdown passes?","target":"Tom Brady","rationale":"In this case, we need to check how many touchdowns each quarterback threw.

These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase.

They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour.

Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\".\\n\\nFounders Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys met at primary school in Meols in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved in different local groups but shared a distaste for guitar driven rock with a macho attitude popular among their friends at the time.  By 1975 McCluskey had formed Equinox, as bassist and vocalist, alongside schoolmate Malcolm Holmes on drums, while Humphreys was their roadie. During that time McCluskey and Humphreys discovered their electronic style influenced by Kraftwerk. After Equinox, McCluskey joined Pegasus, and, later, the short-lived Hitlerz Underpantz, alongside Humphreys. McCluskey would usually sing and play bass guitar; roadie and electronics enthusiast Humphreys graduated to keyboards. The pair shared a love of electronic music, particularly Brian Eno and Kraftwerk.  In September 1977, McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group The Id, whose line-up included drummer Malcolm Holmes and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the Merseyside area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\\"Julia's Song\\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street. Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side-project called VCL XI (named after a misreading of a valve from the diagram on the back cover of Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity album; the name of valve is actually written with Arabic numbers, VCL 11, and not Roman numerals). This side-project allowed them to pursue their more bizarre electronic experiments, often working with tape collages, home-made kit-built synthesisers, and circuit-bent radios.  In August 1978, The Id split due to musical differences. The same month, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit Dalek I Love You as their lead singer, but quit in September.\\n\\nAre there any compilation of recordings?","target":"They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\\"Julia's Song\\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street.","rationale":"The context states: \\"They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\\"Julia's Song\\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street.\\"\\nThus it can be inferred that there are some recordings."},{"source":"You are provided with an \\"Event\\", \\"Intent\\" related to PersonX.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it.

In many of these systems, the different levels of award and honour reflect the Imperial system they replaced.
