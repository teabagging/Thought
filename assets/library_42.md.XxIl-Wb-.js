Passage:Cissé was born in Niamey, Niger. As a child he assumed that he would work in his father's law firm. He became interested in science through Hollywood films. In Niamey there were few opportunities to practise science as his school did not have a laboratory. He was keen to move to America to study, and completed high school two years early. He moved to the United States at the age of 17 to attend college. Cissé studied physics at the North Carolina Central University and graduated in 2004. During his undergraduate degree he was encouraged by Carl Wieman to apply for a fellowship, and spent a summer at Princeton University working in condensed matter physics. During this summer project he looked at jammed disordered packings, investigating how M&M's arrange in a small volume with Paul Chaikin. Cissé used various techniques to study jammed packings, including magnetic resonance imaging, but in the end used a much simpler approach - painting M&M's and analysing how many times they knocked into each other. The result was published in Science. He moved to Urbana for his graduate studies, and earned his PhD under the supervision of single molecule biophysicist Taekjip Ha at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 2009. After completing his doctorate, Cissé joined the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He worked as a Pierre Gilles de Gennes Fellow in the joint labs of a physicist, Maxime Dahan, and a biologist, Xavier Darzacq. He also held a long-term fellowship with the European Molecular Biology Organization. In Paris, Cissé developed the single-cell microscopy technique time-correlated photoactivated localization microscopy (tcPALM), allowing for time resolved measurements in vitro. Cissé used transient-PALM to demonstrated that RNA polymerase II forms clusters that deconstruct after their work is done. Until Cissé made this discovery it was assumed that RNA polymerases were stable.\\n Links: a. École normale supérieure (Paris) b. In vitro c. North Carolina Central University d.

Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended 2.5 miles (4 km) in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists...","target":"42","rationale":"The article clearly states that \\"41 or 42 people died in the incident\\", so there are only two possible numbers of deaths due to lava dome collapse: 41 and 42.\\nTherefore, answer is either A) 41 B)42"},{"source":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\\nArticle: Will it matter if you don't have your breakfast?

In another study, researchers found that humans don't really develop the ability to handle multiple pieces of information at once until about the ages of 16 or 17. The brain of an 18-year-old college freshman is still far from resembling the brain of someone in their mid-twenties, said Craig Bennett, a graduate student who was involved in the new research. A group of 17 older students, ranging in age from 25 to 35, served as a control group for comparison. The results showed that the freshmen students' brains underwent significant changes and were very different from that of the older adults. The changes were localized to the cingulate, caudate and insula regions of the brain.

Neuroscientists are confirming what car rental places already figured out — the brain doesn't fully mature until age 25. Up until this age, the prefrontal cortex — the part of the brain that helps curb impulsive behavior — is not yet fully developed. Some scientists say this could illuminate a potential factor behind a recent spate of acts of mass violence, almost all of which have been perpetrated by men between the ages of 20 and 30. At what age is your brain fully developed? Brain Development. Humans are not born with fully developed brains. As we age, our brains are constantly adapting and growing based on our experiences by generating new neural pathways and synapses. However, there is an age at which most people's brains are fully developed. Answer and Explanation: Until the age around 25 your brain is not fully developed. The exact age varies person to person, but it's around 25 The study will be detailed in an upcoming print issue of the journal Human Brain Mapping. 1  Why Teens are Lousy at Chores. 2  Study: Your Brain Works Like the Internet. 3  Children Beat Adults in Memory Contest. 4  Mental Exercise Nearly Halves Risk of Dementia. 5  Higher Education Fuels Stronger Belief in Ghosts.

Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages. They concentrated in trade, services, and especially in money lending. They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews.[citation needed] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.\\n\\nParagraph: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.","target":"Brown","rationale":"The Brown farm is the only one that grew cover crops, which extends AM fungi growth into the spring.

Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process.

In this study protein conservation was not achieved by increasing caloric intake up to and beyond two times the basal energy expenditure in the brain-injured patient.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine.\\nQuestion: What field does the author most probably work in?\\nOptions:\\n- sales \\n - medicine \\n - Health and nutrition \\n - not enough information\\n===\\nThe correct answer is","target":"Health and nutrition","rationale":"The author is talking about how to eat on a budget, and the answer should be chosen from this context.\\n- Sales: The article does not mention anything related to sales.\\n- Medicine: The article does not focus on medicine or diseases.\\n- Health and nutrition : This option fits with the given information best because it talks about eating healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains etc.."},{"source":"Which of these best indicates that sediments can be changed into rock?\\n\\nOptions:\\n- layers of sandstone\\n- igneous intrusions\\n- lava beds\\n- mountains with gneiss","target":"layers of sandstone","rationale":"The question asks about the evidence for sediment being changed into rock.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes.

Passage 1:Smith assumed that workers could be paid as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by David Ricardo and Thomas Robert Malthus into the \\"iron law of wages\\". His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production. He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions. Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income. Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the globalisation literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace. Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the Poor Relief Act that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the East India Company over India in 1858.\\n Passage 2:He had an exceptional gift for languages and mastered Latin and Greek very early; in his edition of Rhodanthe et Dosiclès, he included a Greek poem that he wrote when he was 16 years old. In 1615, his friend Jacques-Philippe de Maussac, in dedicating his De lapidum virtutibus to Gaulmin, called him a “pentaglot,” knowing, besides Latin and Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Turkish. In 1639, Scottish mathematician James Hume, comparing Gaulmin to Pico della Mirandola, praised him for also knowing Persian and Armenian. In 1648, Balthazar Gerbier also credited him with the knowledge of Italian and Spanish. He learned Arabic first with Étienne Hubert, royal physician and professor of Arabic at the Collège de France, and then under Gabriel Sionita, a Maronite who arrived in Paris in 1614 and who succeeded Hubert. Gaulmin was taught Hebrew by a converted Jewish man, Philippe d'Aquin, who in 1610 was named a professor of Hebrew at the Collège de France. A letter from Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, dated 1635, indicates that Gaulmin had at his service “Hazard, student from Lebanon” (“le sieur Hazard, estudiant au mont Liban”), the last name also spelled “Hazand,” “Hazaed,” or “Hazaid”; the name of the author indicated in the translation of the Livre des lumières (“David Sahid of Ispahan, capital city of Persia) is doubtless that of this man.\\n Passage 3:The first mention of modern Hägglingen is in 1036 when Count Ulrich von Lenzburg granted the church and farm of Hekelingen to Beromünster. In the acknowledgments of Emperor Henry III in 1045, the village of Hackelingen was mentioned. Frederick I Barbarossa acknowledged the grants to the village in 1173. The Vogtei (bailiwick) went from the Lenzburg family to the Kyburgs and then in 1273 to the Lords of Hallwyl. The high court rights were exercised by the Habsburgs until the Swiss conquered the Aargau in 1415.

It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.\\n\\n- A title is a prefix or suffix added to someone's name in certain contexts. It may signify either veneration, an official position or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted before a last name (for example, \\"Graf\\" in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary.\\n\\n- New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").\\n\\n- Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.\\n\\n- New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- Te Whipounamu (Mori for \\"the place of greenstone\\") is a World Heritage Site in the south west corner of the South Island of New Zealand.\\n\\n- In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate.\\n\\n- Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.\\n\\n- Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.\\n\\n- Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.\\n\\n- Milford Sound ( Mori : Piopiotahi ) is a fiord in the south west of New Zealand 's South Island , within Fiordland National Park , Piopiotahi ( Milford Sound ) Marine Reserve , and the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage site .

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement.

Thus it makes sense that we can't pick him out to answer what is the name of Revati' s husband."},{"source":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\\n\\nHarold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 - 13 January 2004) was a British general practitioner and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen murders for killing patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released. The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes.\\n\\nIn March 1998, Linda Reynolds of the Donneybrook Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Son's funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; the Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people. His last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. Shipman was the last person to see her alive and later signed her death certificate, recording \\"old age\\" as the cause of death.  In August 1998, taxi driver John Shaw, from Hyde, contacted the police, informing them that he suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left PS386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and she went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his computerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.  The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health.  Prescription For Murder, a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, advanced two theories on Shipman's motive for forging the will: that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or that he planned to retire at age 55 and leave the UK.  In 2003, David Spiegelhalter et al. suggested that \\"statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998.\\"\\n\\nwhat happened with the investigation?","target":"The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate.","rationale":"This passage is a part of the investigation that took place after Shipman was reported to be suspicious.

While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease.\\nGlendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time.

I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing. With it I set to work on the flow of words and the river of thoughts, both dark and hopeful that careened through my tired mind. Instead of sleep, I would write. I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.;\\nQuestion: A cold water process is used when extracting bitumen from what?;\\nAnswer:","target":"Answer not in context","rationale":"The context mentions that a hot water process is used to extract bitumen from sand.

These thermodynamic properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy, for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e., vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a free radical chain-breaking antioxidant. This review discusses: (i) the thermodynamics of free radical reactions that are of interest to the health sciences; (ii) the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are associated with chain-breaking antioxidants; (iii) the unique interfacial nature of the apparent reaction of the tocopherol free radical (vitamin E radical) and vitamin C; and (iv) presents a hierarchy, or pecking order, for free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions..

During Travis's first class, his teacher talks about how Cooper and his church had their town ridiculed for his racial actions and beliefs. Later, Jared (Kyle Gallner), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun). They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman.Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle (but doesn't tell him about what he was doing out on the back road).Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Here, Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon/monologue before his warped followers about sin reeks in the world and that all evil must be eradicated before the end of the world comes which is their one-way ticket into Heaven. Cooper then identifies another captive, a homosexual young man they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using saran wrap and violently execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together; thus revealing that the Five Points Church is responsible for all the hate...","target":"Red State","rationale":"The plot summary describes the 2011 film Red State."},{"source":"Given two sentences regarding the stereotypes of religions, determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth.\\nNirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances.

That said, the writing style is more in line with Jane Austen than some of the modern authors.  But, I wouldn't call this book Harry Potter done by Jane Austen.  Its also a fairly hard book to get into which is highly different from the pickup and readability of Harry Potter.I don't even want to talk about what the book is about and my recommendation is to not read the book jacket because it basically tells you the entire story.  Strange and Norrell tells the story of a magician, Norrell, who wants to bring magic back to England under his own terms.  But it doesn't start out like that.  It starts out with totally different characters who consider themselves magicians but don't practice.  Then it becomes a different novel about Norrell and his personal idealogies...then it involves Strange and tells his whole life history up to this moment before showing his ideologies.Part of the problem with the novel in its early pages is that it has a ton of beginnings.  It feels like the story will be about one thing but then introducing someone else gives another beginning to the story.  Its filled with too many false starts.  It also spends a large portion of the book setting up what will unfold in the last two hundred pages; in fact the majority of the story dictated in the book flap happens in the last half of the novel.  Fans of very pickup and read novels will probably be turned off early on.  Its a shame because this novel is very rich.It has a lot of subtext involving the time period (1800s) that fans/history buffs of the time period will enjoy.  I hate to call it a historical fiction, but it closely resembles this but with a fantastical twist (namely magic).  Susanna Clarke spends a good deal of time describing the time period, the setting, the characters, their motivations, etc that you really do get a good feeling for the characters.  She does a good job developing characters that will definitely have an idealogical and moral confrontation.  Clarke does tend to lean on cliches every now and then, what with the yes-men surrounding Norell and their tireless bickering on who's better.  Its handled deftly, but its still cliched at parts.My recommendation is that if you enjoy a quick read (and I don't mean page length) then I would just check this novel out.  If you are interested in devoting a good portion of your time to a novel that is thick with description, characterization and a plot that involves a ton of setup and involves a ton of characters that need to be introduced, then this is a good novel for you.\\nquestion: How unusual is this book?","target":"this book has been unfairly advertised","rationale":"The text span \\"this book has been unfairly advertised\\" helps answer the question in a concise and straightforward manner."},{"source":"Is the premise \\"A person is at a rodeo trying to dodge getting hit from a horse.\\" true if \\"A person is at the rodeo dodging the horse.\\"?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"The premise and hypothesis both talk about a person dodging the horse at a rodeo.

Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.","target":"Lemuria","rationale":"Lemuria experienced natural disasters like tornadoes, hurricanes and typhoons while Oceania only had milder weather."},{"source":"Answer the following question.\\nWhich was the first James Bond film directed by Sam Mendes?","target":"Sky Fall","rationale":"Sam Mendes directed SkyFall, which is the 23rd James Bond film.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.Reznor coined the name \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" because it \\"abbreviated easily\\", rather than for \\"any literal meaning\\".

During early adolescence, adolescents often associate in cliques, exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close. Despite the common notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence, they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity. Within a clique of highly athletic male-peers, for example, the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition. Cliques also have become somewhat a \\"collective parent,\\" i.e. telling the adolescents what to do and not to do. Towards late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another. These small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented. On a larger scale, adolescents often associate with crowds, groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity. Often, crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people, such as jocks or nerds. In large, multi-ethnic high schools, there are often ethnically-determined crowds. While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence, they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually.\\"?","target":"What kind of group is single-sex?","rationale":"The passage talks about cliques and crowds as two types of associations among adolescents.

Passage:His on-air return finally took place at the WWF's Super-Stars & Stripes Forever USA Network special on March 17, 1991, when he came out to shake the hand of The Big Boss Man after an altercation with Mr. Perfect. The following week, at WrestleMania VII, he came to the aid of the Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Roussimoff finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich) Making it his last WWF match. His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Roussimoff one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Roussimoff and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Roussimoff to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Roussimoff denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Roussimoff from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Roussimoff's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Roussimoff was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack him, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Roussimoff, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Roussimoff's crutch, allowing Smith to win.\\n Links: a. The Natural Disasters b. Big Boss Man (wrestler) c. WrestleMania VII d.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nJohn has to live in the tundra for six months.

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

He studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In 1897, he became a professor at the Theological Seminary in Ljubljana. In 1919, he became a professor at the Faculty of Theology at the University of Ljubljana, where he taught philosophy. In 1922 and 1923, he served as the fourth chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. In 1937, he became a member of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas and in 1938 one of the founding members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana (later renamed the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts). In 1948, he was expelled from the academy by the new communist regime. His membership was reinstated in 1996 after the collapse of communism.\\n Passage 2:The video begins with an introduction of Dr. Dre's music career, such as when he and fellow N.W.A member DJ Yella were in the 1980s funk group World Class Wreckin' Cru.

As the Swift boats reached the Cửa Lớn River, Kerry's boat was hit by a B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely.

The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris.\\nWhen Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.

Pain that starts to get worse after two days is considered abnormal and you may want to see your dentist. This could be a sign of “dry socket”. Dry Socket. A dry socket occurs when the blood clot for healing becomes dislodged or doesn’t form. In that case, the bone and fine nerve endings are not protected and exposed to air, food, and liquids. Dry socket delays the healing process and can be very painful. If you suspect dry socket, see your dentist. For example, after evaluating the outcome of 400 wisdom tooth extractions, Sweet (1979) [page references] determined that: Patients who smoked 10 cigarettes a day experienced a more than fourfold rate of dry socket formation (12% vs 2.6%). The rate for patients who smoked 20 cigarettes daily was 20% higher. If the extracted tooth is shallow-rooted premolar, an incisor or a canine, and it has no major infection, an immediate implant placement can be performed. If the extracted tooth is a molar with a healthy supporting bone, an immediate-delayed implant placement procedure (about two weeks to three months) can be performed. If the extracted tooth has a bone loss from disease in the gum, then a delayed or late implant (three months or more after tooth extraction) can be conducted.Learn more about Dental. Here are some correlations: 1  Having a back tooth pulled (especially a molar) typically poses a greater risk than a front tooth. 2  The risk of dry socket formation is 10 times higher when a lower tooth is extracted, as opposed to an upper one. It can be painful for days while the body walls off and isolates the dead bone. The answer to your question is that there is always a risk of getting a dry socket if the blood clot is disturbed, and that risk continues with decreasing likelihood for the twenty one days while wound healing and closure occurs. If you are a regular tobacco user refrain from smoking for the next 3-4 days as smoking increases your chances of getting a dry socket as well as an infection. After your tooth has been extracted, healing will take some time. Within 3 to 14 days, your sutures should fall out or dissolve. For sutures that are non-resorbable, your doctor will schedule a follow-up appointment to remove the stitches for you. The first thing I did after I got 2 teeth extracted was to go to friends house and smoke weed. The effect anesthesia was fading and weed really helped. I also smoked the next day after getting 2 other teeth extracted. Nothing happened. I had no idea about this thing called dry socket and am happy I didn't get it. If I knew, I might not have smoked. Pain alone is not necessarily an indication that you have a dry socket. However, if you feel increased pain two days after the surgery in addition to other dry socket symptoms, your socket is probably dry. Usually, a dry socket heals itself after five days and the pain disappears. I haven't because I don't want the dry sockets.

Peer feedback has confirmed an increase in affect; students that have increasing responsibilities have more drive towards their work and a spike in confidence.[6] Furthermore, Kristanto (2018) found that peer feedback is an essential element of peer assessment.

In the late 1950s, Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet. Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz. About him, German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt commented, \\"His ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing.\\n\\nHaden often said that he moved to Los Angeles in 1957 in search of pianist Hampton Hawes. He turned down a full scholarship at Oberlin College, which did not have an established jazz program at the time, to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles. His first recordings were made that year with Paul Bley, with whom he worked until 1959. He also played with Art Pepper for four weeks in 1957, and from 1958 to 1959, with Hampton Hawes whom he met through his friendship with bassist Red Mitchell, For a time, he shared an apartment with the bassist Scott LaFaro.  In May 1959, he recorded his first album with the Ornette Coleman Quartet, the seminal The Shape of Jazz to Come. Haden's folk-influenced style complemented Coleman's microtonal, Texas blues elements. Later that year, the Quartet moved to New York City and secured an extended booking at the avant-garde Five Spot Cafe. This residency lasted six weeks and represented the beginnings of their unique, free and avant-garde jazz. Ornette's quartet played everything by ear, as Haden explained: \\"At first when we were playing and improvising, we kind of followed the pattern of the song, sometimes. Then, when we got to New York, Ornette wasn't playing on the song patterns, like the bridge and the interlude and stuff like that. He would just play. And that's when I started just following him and playing the chord changes that he was playing: on-the-spot new chord structures made up according to how he felt at any given moment.\\"  In 1960, addiction to narcotics caused him to leave Coleman's band. He went to self-help rehabilitation in September 1963 at Synanon houses in Santa Monica, California and San Francisco, California. It was during the time he was at Synanon House that he met his first wife, Ellen David. They moved to New York City's Upper West Side where their four children were born: their son, Josh, in 1968, and in 1971, their triplet daughters Petra, Rachel and Tanya. They separated in 1975 and, subsequently, divorced.\\n\\nWhat did he do instead?","target":"to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles.","rationale":"From the given context, it is clear that he had obtained a full scholarship at Oberlin College, but what did he do instead?\\nThe answer is to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction.

In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, \\"Raetia\\" and \\"Vindelicia\\" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and \\"Italia\\" (\\"Venetia et Histria\\") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.\\n\\n- Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235  284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire.\\n\\n- The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.\\n\\n- Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania.\\nArchaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.\\nDuring the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.\\n\\n- The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.\\n\\n- Flavius Ricimer (; c. 405  August 18, 472) was a Romanized Germanic general who effectively ruled the remaining territory of the Western Roman Empire from 456 until his death in 472. Deriving his power from his position as \\"magister militum\\" of the Western Empire, Ricimer exercised political control through a series of puppet emperors.\\n\\n- Aegidius ( died 464 or 465 ) was a Gallo - Roman warlord of northern Gaul . He had been promoted as magister militum in Gaul under Aëtius around 450 . An ardent supporter of Majorian , Aegidius rebelled when Ricimer deposed Majorian , engaging in several campaigns against the Visigoths and creating a Roman rump state that came to be known as the Domain of Soissons . After winning an important victory over the Visigoths he died suddenly , and was succeeded by his son Syagrius . Ralph Mathisen points out the name of Aegidius ' son , Syagrius , \`\` would suggest that he was related to the Syagrii of Lyons , one of the oldest , most aristocratic families of Gaul . Aegidius , in fact , has been proposed as a grandson of Flavius Afranius Syagrius , consul in 382 '' . Other Syagrii Mathisen lists with a connection to Gaul are a great - grandson of Afranius , who had an estate at Taionnacus near Lyons , and a wealthy Syagria of Lyons who was described by Magnus Felix Ennodius as thesaurus ecclesiae .\\n\\n- Flavius Julius Valerius Majorianus (c. AD 420  August 7, 461), usually known simply as Majorian, was the Western Roman Emperor from 457 to 461.\\n\\n- Syagrius (430  486 or 487) was the last Roman military commander in Gaul, whose defeat by king Clovis I of the Franks is considered the end of Western Roman rule outside of Italy. He came to this position through inheritance, for his father was Aegidius, the last Roman \\"magister militum per Gallias\\". Syagrius preserved his father's rump state between the Somme and the Loire around Soissons after the collapse of central rule in the Western Empire, a domain Gregory of Tours called the \\"Kingdom\\" of Soissons. Syagrius governed this Gallo-Roman enclave from the death of his father in 464 until 486, when he was defeated in battle by Clovis I.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Soissons is a commune in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France in northern France, located on the Aisne River, about northeast of Paris. It is one of the most ancient towns of France, and is probably the ancient capital of the Suessiones. Soissons is also the see of an ancient Roman Catholic diocese, whose establishment dates from about 300.\\n\\n- Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'floruit' with '457'.","target":"aegidius","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"aegidius\\"."},{"source":"Spitting Image is a British satirical puppet show, created by Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn. The series was produced by 'Spitting Image Productions' for Central Independent Television over 18 series which aired on the ITV network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including 10 BAFTA Television Awards, including one for editing in 1989 and two Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category. The series featured puppet caricatures of celebrities prominent during the 1980s and 1990s, including British Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major and other politicians, US president Ronald Reagan, and the British Royal Family; the series was the first to caricature Queen Elizabeth\\n\\nIn an attempt to crack the American market, there were some attempts to produce a US version of the show. A 45-minute 'made for market' show by the original Spitting Image team, titled Spitting Image: Down and Out in the White House was produced in 1986 by Central for the NBC network.  Introduced by David Frost, it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election. The plot involved a conspiracy to replace Ronald Reagan with a double (actually actor Dustin Hoffman in disguise). This plan was hatched by the Famous Corporation, a cabal of the ultra-rich headed by Johnny Carson's foil Ed McMahon (in the show, Carson was his ineffectual left-hand man) who met in a secret cavern hollowed out behind the facade of Mount Rushmore. Eventually, their plot foiled, the famous corporation activated their escape pod - Abraham Lincoln's nose - and left Earth for another planet, but (in a homage to the beginning of the Star Wars movies) were destroyed during a collision with 'a nonsensical prologue in gigantic lettering'.  The show was not very successful with its target audience, possibly because its humour was still very British and it was so irreverent about Ronald Reagan at a time when he was enormously popular with the American public. It did, however, receive great praise from critics and it was followed by several more television specials: The Ronnie & Nancy Show (also satirising the Reagans), The 1987 Movie Awards (sending up the Academy Awards), Bumbledown: The Life and Times of Ronald Reagan (a quasi-documentary about the President), and The Sound of Maggie (satirising Thatcher and parodying several musicals such as Oliver!, West Side Story and many others).\\n\\nCan you give me more information regarding this show?","target":"Introduced by David Frost, it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election.","rationale":"The context describes the US version of Spitting Image.

The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote \\"This my pious Mother ... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard ... I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it.\\"\\nBarbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, indicating her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of her nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been \\"comely and of erect bearing\\". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the  imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- Frank Conrad (May 4, 1874  December 10, 1941) was an electrical engineer, best known for radio development, including his work as a pioneer broadcaster. He worked for the Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for half a century. His experimental radio station provided the inspiration, and he acted in an advisory role, for the establishment of Westinghouse's first broadcasting service, over radio station KDKA.\\n\\n- In electronics, a vacuum tube, an electron tube, or just a tube (North America), or valve (Britain and some other regions), is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container.\\nVacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.\\n\\n- Analog television (or analogue television) is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio. In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the amplitude, frequency or phase of the signal.\\n\\n- The digital television transition , also called the digital switchover or analog switch - off ( ASO ) , is the process in which analog television broadcasting is converted to and replaced by digital television . This primarily involves the conversion of analog terrestrial television to digital terrestrial . However , it also involves analog cable conversion to digital cable , as well as analog to digital satellite . In many countries , a simulcast service is operated where a broadcast is made available to viewers in both analog and digital at the same time . As digital becomes more popular , it is likely that the existing analog services will be removed . In some cases this has already happened , where a broadcaster has offered incentives to viewers to encourage them to switch to digital . In other cases government policies have been introduced to encourage or force the switchover process , especially with regard to terrestrial broadcasts . Government intervention usually involves providing some funding for broadcasters and , in some cases monetary relief to viewers , to enable a switchover to happen by a given deadline . The switchover for individual countries varies ; in some countries it is being implemented in stages as in India and the United Kingdom , where each region has a separate date to switch off . In others , the whole country switches on one date , such as the Netherlands , which switched off all analog services on 11 December 2006 . Some countries have different switch off dates for each channel , such as China where CCTV channels 1 - 5 were switched off first .\\n\\n- The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.\\n\\n- Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\\nAnalog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.\\n\\n- Motorola, Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, United States. After having lost $4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, the company was divided into two independent public companies, Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4, 2011. Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola, Inc., as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off. Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo in 2014.\\n\\n- Color television is a television transmission technology that includes information on the color of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set. It is an improvement on the earliest television technology, monochrome or black and white television, in which the image is displayed in shades of grey (greyscale). Television broadcasting stations and networks in most parts of the world upgraded from black and white to color transmission in the 1960s and 1970s. The invention of color television standards is an important part of the history of television, and it is described in the technology of television article.\\n\\n- Arris Group is an American telecommunications equipment manufacturing company that provides cable operators with high-speed data, video and telephony systems for homes and businesses. The company is headquartered in Suwanee, Georgia, and has design, engineering, manufacturing, distribution, service and sales office locations throughout the world.\\nTwo of the company's popular home telephony modems are the TM402P and the TM502G. The firm also produces the SBG6580 wireless cable modem-and-router (residential gateway) unit, among other telecommunications and data-transfer products.\\n\\n- Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\n\\n- In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current. When a connected antenna is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits radio waves.\\n\\n- A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.\\n\\n- Digital cable is any type of cable television distribution using digital video compression for USE. The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. \\n\\n- General Instrument (GI) was an American electronics manufacturer based in Horsham, Pennsylvania specializing in semiconductors and cable television equipment. The company was active until 1997, when it split into General Semiconductor (power semiconductors, which was later acquired by Vishay Intertechnology in November 2001), CommScope and NextLevel Systems.\\n\\n- A telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals suitable for transmission via cables or other transmission media over long distances, and replays such signals simultaneously in audible form to its user.\\n\\n- An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., \\"analogous\\" to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves. It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values. The term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals; however, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.\\nAn analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. In an electrical signal, the voltage, current, or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information.\\nAny information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure. The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a transducer. For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone. The voltage or the current is said to be an \\"analog\\" of the sound.\\nAn analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution. In practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, digital signals have a finite resolution. Converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low-level noise called...\\n\\n- Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.\\n\\n- Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.\\n\\n- Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.\\n\\n- Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.\\n\\n- Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.\\n\\n- Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Several regions of the world are in different stages of adaptation and are implementing different broadcasting standards. Below are the different widely used digital television broadcasting standards (DTB):\\n\\n- Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.\\n\\n- An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of insulated wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.\\n\\n- Pay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it (as opposed to video-on-demand systems, which allow viewers to see recorded broadcasts at any time). Events can be purchased using an on-screen guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live customer service representative. Events often include feature films, sporting events, and other entertainment programs. With the rise of the Internet, the term Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) has been used to describe pay-per-view services accessed online. PPV is most commonly used to distribute combat sports events, such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling.\\n\\n- An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.\\n\\n\\n\\n'digital television transition' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'part of'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 2000s\\n - 2010s\\n - 20th century\\n - art\\n - back\\n - boxing\\n - broadcasting\\n - center\\n - communication\\n - communication technology\\n - company\\n - december\\n - design\\n - education\\n - electromagnetic radiation\\n - electromagnetic spectrum\\n - electronic\\n - electronics\\n - engineering\\n - equipment\\n - event\\n - evolution\\n - floor\\n - hand\\n - human\\n - internet\\n - martial arts\\n - mass\\n - may\\n - medium\\n - mixed martial arts\\n - music\\n - part\\n - participation\\n - production\\n - radiation\\n - station\\n - system\\n - technology\\n - telecommunication\\n - television programming\\n - the collection\\n - the wire\\n - work","target":"technology","rationale":"The first two sentences of the text is: \\"Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers.

Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- A Chinese Ghost Story is a 1987 Hong Kong romantic comedy horror film starring Leslie Cheung, Joey Wong and Wu Ma, directed by Ching Siu-tung and produced by Tsui Hark. The plot was loosely based on a short story from Qing dynasty writer Pu Songling's \\"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\\" (), and also inspired by the 1960 Shaw Brothers Studio film, \\"The Enchanting Shadow\\". The film was popular in Hong Kong and several Asian countries, including South Korea and Japan, when released. Most notably it boosted the stardom of Joey Wong, won Leslie Cheung popularity in Japan, and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the Hong Kong film industry, including two sequels, an animated film, a television series and a 2011 remake.

These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as \\"families\\", \\"sects\\" or \\"schools\\" of martial arts. Examples of such traits include \\"Shaolinquan\\" physical exercises involving Five Animals mimicry, or training methods inspired by Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called \\"internal\\", while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called \\"external\\". Geographical association, as in \\"northern\\" and \\"southern\\", is another popular classification method.\\n\\n- Martial arts film is a film genre. A subgenre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters.

It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.\\nThe conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent. An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions, and it suggests acupuncture may be effective only for chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and idiopathic headache. A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain. The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo. A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.\\n\\n- Once Upon a Time in China is a 1991 Hong Kong martial arts film written and directed by Tsui Hark, starring Jet Li as Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung.

Nationalism is further oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, religion, political goals and/or a belief in a common ancestry. Nationalism therefore seeks to preserve the nation's culture. It often also involves a sense of pride in the nation's achievements, and is closely linked to the concept of patriotism.

She had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels. No signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome developed, and the central regulation of secretion of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL (insulin test, diurnal rhythm) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point. We conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary (partial) cortisol insensitivity, which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion. The latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family, but had in the propositus. The results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from Cushing's disease.","target":"Adrenal Cortex Hormones","rationale":"The abstract describes a case study of an individual with hereditary cortisol insensitivity.

The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown.

A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). On the Broncos' next possession, Manning threw his first interception of the season, and the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater, however, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired. This was the only game during the 2013 season in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question. How many yards difference was Romo's first touchdown pass to Dez Bryant compared to Romo's touchdown pass to Jason Witten?","target":"8","rationale":"The goal of this problem is to calculate the yards difference between Romo's first touchdown pass to Bryant and his touchdown pass in fourth quarter. Before that, we have to check how many yards were passed on each plays. In the passage, it is said that \\"a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo\\" was made when Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead; while \\"Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten\\".

Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter?","target":"Sarahn","rationale":"When continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity.

The principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The presence of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids, especially dehydroepiandrosterone. The secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol. In the absence of hLDL, ACTH increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion. After ACTH treatment, increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97K protein in human fetal adrenal cells. Interestingly, the content of this enzyme in cells treated with ACTH in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue. This finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma LDL is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland.","target":"Acetates","rationale":"The abstract does not provide any information about acetates.

A similar LPC has been reported in cats and monkeys. In this study, the LPC of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in the cat was used to detect impairment in attention to a relevant stimulus after low levels of cerebral concussion produced by a fluid percussion device. A hollow screw (for fluid percussion) and stainless steel screws (for AEP recording) were surgically placed in the skull. After recovery from surgery, animals were trained in the paradigm to obtain an LPC. Pupillary dilation was conditioned to tones. A random sequence of two discriminable tones was presented. The lower tone had a probability of 0.1 and was followed by a tail shock (tone-shock). After 400 to 1000 tone-shock presentations, animals attended to the lower tone stimulus as inferred by selective pupillary dilation. In the AEP an early positive component at 50 to 120 msec related to an alerting response was enhanced, and an LPC at 250 to 450 msec appeared in response to the paired tone-shock. Animals were then subjected to cerebral concussion. Complete recovery of normal reflexes, motor coordination, and orienting response was seen within 2 hours after injury. The LPC was suppressed for a period of at least 3 days, suggesting that low magnitudes of brain injury can disrupt higher-order neural activities.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

Wonderful modern decor, very friendly staff (happily recommended restaurants, etc, to those of us who could get lost in a closet - much less a town like SF). The rooms are spacious, clean, and (though geared to the business traveler) worked fine for our weekend leisurely trip (and the beds were SO comfy!). Great views, and a long desk stretching across the full length of the room near the windows.Given the location, at first we were a little worried about not being within walking distance of Union Square (or the cable cars/Muni), but hey - it's San Francisco. Everything's close. Market Street, Union Square, BART, and North Beach are all just a short distance on foot. You can catch the cable car at California Street...which is even closer. In fact, we found it kind of nice to be out of the uber-touristy area of Union Square proper. We were right on the border of Chinatown, and wound up spending some time in North Beach - a cool area that I had never frequented up until this point.My only complaint is this: the Hilton is one of those hotels that charges you $160 a night for a room...then still wants you to pay them $10 a day to access the internet. Even going to the business center to check your email results in the same charge. I know that a lot of people stay here on business, so I imagine the hotel thinks it can milk a little extra from its guests by allowing them to employ the &quot;Oh, the company's paying for it, no big deal&quot; mindset...but come on. It's 2006. And it's San Francisco, people! The Google company shuttle stops down the street! Get with the program. Overall, though, a wonderful experience.

The hotel laundry  ruined your favorite shirt. The taxi driver overcharged you. When you're abroad, sometimes things go wrong. Now you can do something about it! Use these tips when you want to express an effective complaint in English.\\nNo matter how unfair the situation, it's best to phrase your complaint politely. In English, you'll sound more polite if you use indirect language. Here are some examples:\\n\\"I'm sorry to bother you...\\" Starting a complaint like this puts the listener who may have heard many complaints that day at ease. Use this phrase if the situation isn't that serious. For example, \\"I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted a baked potato, not fries.\\"\\n\\"Can you help me with this?\\" Everyone would much rather be asked to do something than told! So try phrasing your complaint as a request for help: \\"Can you help me with this? My shirt came back from the laundry without buttons.\\"\\n\\"I'm afraid there may be a misunderstanding.\\" This is a polite way of saying, \\"Your information is wrong. Please fix it now.\\" You'll most likely use this phrase if you made reservations  for a flight, hotel or restaurant, and when you arrive, it's not what you expected. For example, \\"I'm afraid there may be a misunderstanding. I requested a non-smoking room.\\"\\n\\"I understand it's not your fault...\\" Often when you make a complaint, you deal with a person who was not directly responsible for the problem. But the problem isn't your fault, either! This phrase is helpful when you need swift action. Tell the person you're dealing with you understand they're not at fault and then directly state the problem: \\"I understand it's not your fault, but the airline promised they would deliver my baggage yesterday.\\"\\n\\"Excuse me, but I understood that...\\" Using this phrase lets the person know you're well-informed and are suspicious they might be trying to take advantage of you.

Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister.

In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.\\nAlthough he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone.  With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, \\"I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably\\". In The Manchester Guardian, Neville Cardus wrote, \\"Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work.\\"In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as \\"gruelling\\", with 12 concerts on 12 successive days.

Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around £70,000, totalling around £3.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine. In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another £3m to a new charitable educational fund. The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, \\"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.

In 796 Carolingian forces under Charlemagne's son Pepin of Italy destroyed the main Avar fortress called the Ring of the Avars and made the Khagan a Frankish vassal, while the remaining Avars retreated behind the Tisza River.

Anyway my friend and I are in a tight money situation so we made it very clear we could not afford this dinner as soon as we sat down. \\n\\nMy other friend Alice decided to be very generous and offer to pay for both my friend and I. Everybody was drinking and we declined but eventually ended up ordering entrees. In retrospect staying at this restaurant was a bad idea anyway because of the money situation.  Wine was ordered and everybody got absolutely hammered.\\n\\nWhen the check comes Alice -who offered to pay - says that the other three people should split the check with her evenly. In effect my roommates ended up shouldering a massive bill and my friend and I’s dinner/tab. \\n\\nToday we made amends and I am going to cover the portion of their bill they each shouldered. I am not asking Alice for money as I am not entitled to it. \\n\\nMy question is if I am the asshole for reserving a dinner I cannot afford (unknowingly) and putting everyone in an uncomfortable position?\\n\\nTLDR: set up a nice dinner I cannot afford and my roommates ended up paying for me.","target":"AUTHOR","rationale":"The author of the post is wrong for organizing a very pricey dinner to which their roommates were invited. The author says that they did not know about the prices of the menu when they made the reservations. It seems odd that they would have organized such an expensive event without having checked first, so it is possible that they knew what kind of restaurant it was and simply chose not to tell their roommates. Either way, it was irresponsible to organize this event without considering how much money everyone had and taking responsibility for ensuring that everyone could afford to attend.

Two years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA.  In the 1946-47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49-11 win-loss record, including a standard-setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games.  The next year the Capitols went 28-20 but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948-49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38-22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.  After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he \\"felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die\\" and that it was \\"no way to get a job\\".  Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949-50 NBA season with a losing record of 28-29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks,","rationale":"The article mentions that Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, which is an interesting fact."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence and a question, you would be asked to create the answer which is contained in the sentence provided.\\n\\nSentence: All members of a species living together form a(n) population.

That's been a little frustrating but understandable. My real annoyance comes from that over the past couple weeks she's made 4 dates with me, and then bailed pretty close to the date each time.

On the other hand I can't help but be unhappy with the situation. \\n\\nThat brings us to the current situation, I asked her last weekend when she would be free next because I'd like to see her. She responded that she was going to be getting off early on Wednesday and we should go out after. I agreed and planned on seeing her Wednesday night. Wednesday morning she texts me to ask if we're still going out, I confirm and we agree I'll pick her up from work. \\n\\nLater on in the day she texts me to say she still wants to go out, but she's gotta be home by 10:30. I was a little disappointed because she often doesn't get off until 9:00 or so, but it had been a couple weeks since I'd seen her so I agreed and told her to let me know when she would be off. She assured me again it would be early because Wednesdays are slow. \\n\\n9:00pm rolls around and I haven't heard from her, so I text to ask if she is still stuck at work.

Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".\\n\\n- A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble.

Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.\\n\\n- Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. \\"Nature\\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\\n\\n- In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017.\\nThe gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\".

The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid, where it circulates to the metanephridia. In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (exit opening in the body wall) are in the following segment. As a result, the hindmost segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure that extracts its wastes, as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them, while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second, but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration","rationale":"The question is asking about the difference in filtration between protonephridia and metanephridia.

The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.\\nScientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against \\"sun bingeing\\".\\nThe government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.\\nVitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight.

It is often said to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's 1837 introduction of Dirichlet \\"L\\"-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It is well known for its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring's problem).\\nBranches of analytic number theory.\\nAnalytic number theory can be split up into two major parts, divided more by the type of problems they attempt to solve than fundamental differences in technique.\\n\\n- Robert O. Schlaifer (13 September 1914  24 July 1994) was a pioneer of Bayesian decision theory. At the time of his death he was William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration Emeritus of the Harvard Business School. In 1961 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\\n\\n- Thomas Bayes (c. 1701 7 April 1761) was an English statistician, philosopher and Presbyterian minister who is known for having formulated a specific case of the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' theorem. Bayes never published what would eventually become his most famous accomplishment; his notes were edited and published after his death by Richard Price.\\n\\n- </math> In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters \\"n\\" and \\"p\\" is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of \\"n\\" independent yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability \\"p\\". A success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or Bernoulli trial; when \\"n\\" = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance.\\n\\n- Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).\\n\\n- Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.\\n\\n- In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distributions \\"p\\"(|\\"x\\") are in the same family as the prior probability distribution \\"p\\"(), the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function. For example, the Gaussian family is conjugate to itself (or \\"self-conjugate\\") with respect to a Gaussian likelihood function: if the likelihood function is Gaussian, choosing a Gaussian prior over the mean will ensure that the posterior distribution is also Gaussian. This means that the Gaussian distribution is a conjugate prior for the likelihood that is also Gaussian. The concept, as well as the term \\"conjugate prior\\", were introduced by Howard Raiffa and Robert Schlaifer in their work on Bayesian decision theory. A similar concept had been discovered independently by George Alfred Barnard.\\n\\n- Bayesian statistics, named for Thomas Bayes (17011761), is a theory in the field of statistics in which the evidence about the true state of the world is expressed in terms of \\"degrees of belief\\" known as Bayesian probabilities. Such an interpretation is only one of a number of interpretations of probability and there are other statistical techniques that are not based on 'degrees of belief'. One of the key ideas of Bayesian statistics is that \\"probability is orderly opinion, and that inference from data is nothing other than the revision of such opinion in the light of relevant new information.\\"\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical function that, stated in simple terms, can be thought of as providing the probability of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. For instance, if the random variable X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss ('the experiment'), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for formula_1, and 0.5 for formula_2. \\n\\n- An \\"a priori\\" probability is a probability that is derived purely by deductive reasoning. One way of deriving \\"a priori\\" probabilities is the principle of indifference, which has the character of saying that, if there are \\"N\\" mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and if they are equally likely, then the probability of a given event occurring is 1/\\"N\\". Similarly the probability of one of a given collection of \\"K\\" events is \\"K\\"/\\"N\\".\\n\\n- ([x=i]) = p_i (1-p_i)</math><br>formula_1|\\n\\n- Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a Fourier series is a way to represent a (wave-like) function as the sum of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials). The discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the NyquistShannon sampling theorem. The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.\\n\\n- In probability and statistics , the Dirichlet distribution ( after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet ) , often denoted \\\\ operatorname ( Dir ) ( \\\\ boldsymbol \\\\ alpha ) , is a family of continuous multivariate probability distributions parameterized by a vector \\\\ boldsymbol \\\\ alpha of positive reals . It is the multivariate generalization of the beta distribution . Dirichlet distributions are very often used as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics , and in fact the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution . The infinite - dimensional generalization of the Dirichlet distribution is the Dirichlet process .\\n\\n- Howard Raiffa (January 24, 1924  July 8, 2016) was an American academic who was the Frank P. Ramsey Professor (Emeritus) of Managerial Economics, a joint chair held by the Business School and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was an influential Bayesian decision theorist and pioneer in the field of decision analysis, with works in statistical decision theory, game theory, behavioral decision theory, risk analysis, and negotiation analysis. He helped found and was the first director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. \\n\\n- Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] parametrized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by \\"\\" and \\"\\", that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution.\\n\\n- Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, assigned probabilities represent states of knowledge or belief.\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, a shape parameter is a kind of numerical parameter of a parametric family of probability distributions.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is unbiased, the two outcomes (\\"head\\" and \\"tail\\") are both equally probable; the probability of \\"head\\" equals the probability of \\"tail\\". Since no other outcomes are possible, the probability is 1/2 (or 50%), of either \\"head\\" or \\"tail\\". In other words, the probability of \\"head\\" is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of \\"tail\\" is also 1 out of 2 outcomes, expressed as 0.5 when converted to decimal, with the above-mentioned quantification system. This type of probability is also called a priori probability.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'named after' with 'johann peter gustav lejeune dirichlet'.","target":"dirichlet distribution","rationale":"For the question \\"what entity has the relation 'named after' with 'johann peter gustav lejeune dirichlet',\\" you would choose \\"dirichlet distribution.\\"\\nThis is because, for example, in paragraph 4 it says: \\"(after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet)\\"."},{"source":"Text: Diploma privilege -- In the United States, the diploma privilege is a method for lawyers to be admitted to the bar without taking a bar examination.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.

Passage:At the beginning of the 2013–14 La Liga season, coach Unai Emery named Rakitić as the new Sevilla captain. Since the beginning of the season, he was one of the most prominent players of the league, scoring the first goal and assisting for the second in a 3–2 away loss against Barcelona on 14 September. In the two last games of September, he scored two goals in a 1–4 away win over Rayo Vallecano, and assisted for the draw 1–1 goal against Real Sociedad. In the final three games of October, Rakitić scored a goal in a 2–0 home win against SC Freiburg, a 2–1 home win over Almería and two goals in a 7–3 loss at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium against Real Madrid. In the third and fourth games of November, he contributed an assist in away 1–3 win against Espanyol, and two more respectively in a 4–0 home win against Sevilla rivals Betis. In the last game of December, he assisted in a 1–2 away win against Villarreal, helping Sevilla reach a top ten position after a disappointing start of the season, as well attracting attention from other international clubs. In the first game of the 2014 calendar year, he scored in a 3–0 home win against Getafe.

During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this.

We can rephrase this question to ask: which parts of the image, if they were not seen by the classifier, would most change its decision? Producing an answer requires marginalizing over images that could have been seen but weren't. We can sample plausible image in-fills by conditioning a generative model on the rest of the image. We then optimize to find the image regions that most change the classifier's decision after in-fill. Our approach contrasts with ad-hoc in-filling approaches, such as blurring or injecting noise, which generate inputs far from the data distribution, and ignore informative relationships between different parts of the image. Our method produces more compact and relevant saliency maps, with fewer artifacts compared to previous methods.","target":"We compute saliency by using a strong generative model to efficiently marginalize over plausible alternative inputs, revealing concentrated pixel areas that preserve label information","rationale":"Here's a brief summary: \\\\nWe compute saliency by using a strong generative model to efficiently marginalize over plausible alternative inputs, revealing concentrated pixel areas that preserve label information."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a string with duplicate characters ocurring in the string.
